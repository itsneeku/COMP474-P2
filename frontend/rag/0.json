It aims to show\nstudent artists as creators of knowledge.”\n\nAs the MMFA is home to the oldest art library in Canada, the museum provided a\nfitting backdrop for the performance. The administration provided access to the\nspace free of charge, allowing the student-led initiative to take shape within\nits walls.\n\n\"The original fresco represents philosophers, mathematicians and scientists,\nwith art playing only a minor role,\" the two explain in the project statement.\n\"Our work reclaimed that space for fine arts creation and acknowledged student\nartists as active contributors to knowledge.\"\n\n[/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-students-revisit-a-masterpiece-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts/_jcr_content/parsys/image.img.jpg/1743705352029.jpg]\n\n\nA CROSS-UNIVERSITY COLLABORATION\n\nThe project brought together fine arts students from both Concordia and UQAM,\nthe two Montreal universities that offer MFA programs. Organizers recruited\naround 25 students from both institutions, with participants dressing in\nmakeshift Roman-style attire and bringing objects that symbolize their artistic\npractice — be it a camera, sketchbook, ceramic piece or a roll of paper.\n\nThe initiative took inspiration from the 2024 Irish project “School of\nHibernia,” staged at Trinity College in Dublin, which reinterpreted “The School\nof Athens” with contemporary women political figures. L’École de Montréal aimed\nto feature student artists, living and learning in Montreal, from a variety of\nbackgrounds.\n\n\nFUTURE PRESENTATIONS\n\nAs the performance took place on a day the museum was closed to the public, the\norganizers are currently exploring ways to showcase the final work to outside\naudiences. Discussions are ongoing about potential presentations at both\nConcordia and UQAM. The project was also documented through photography and\nvideo.\n\n\nTo find out more on the project, visit the Las Sabinas project page\n[http://las-sabinas.wikidot.com/projects].\n\nLearn more about Concordia’s Faculty of Fine Arts [/finearts.html].\n\n \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRELATED TOPICS\n\n\ntheatre [/news/topic.html?topic=topics:academic_disciplines/theatre] arts\n[/news/topic.html?topic=topics:academic_disciplines/arts] culture\n[/news/topic.html?topic=topics:research_subjects/culture] students\n[/news/topic.html?topic=topics:people_places_entities/students]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShare on Facebook\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/facebook-round.png]\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-students-revisit-a-masterpiece-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts.html\nShare on Twitter\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/twitter-round.png]\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-students-revisit-a-masterpiece-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts.html\nShare on LinkedIn\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/linkedin-round.png]\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-students-revisit-a-masterpiece-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts.html\nEmail this story\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/email-round.png]\n?subject=Concordia students revisit a masterpiece at the Montreal Museum of Fine\nArts&body=Participants put their twist on a classic Raphael fresco through a\ncollaborative, cross-university\nperformance%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.concordia.ca%2Fnews%2Fstories%2F2025%2F04%2F03%2Fconcordia-students-revisit-a-masterpiece-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts.html\n\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\n * Concordia fine arts students team up with the Canadian Centre for\n   Architecture\n   [/cunews/main/stories/2025/03/27/concordia-fine-arts-students-team-up-with-the-canadian-centre-for-architecture.html]\n * Concordia's Sandeep Bhagwati kicks off a busy spring season April 20-21 with\n   two concerts at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts\n   [/news/stories/2024/04/18/concordia-s-sandeep-bhagwati-kicks-off-a-busy-spring-season-april-20-21-with-two-concerts-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts.html]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-students-revisit-a-masterpiece-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts.html","title":"Concordia students revisit a masterpiece at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts - Concordia University","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"CONCORDIA LAUNCHES NEW FRENCH LANGUAGE COURSES FOR ALL STUDENTS\n\nDynamic six-credit classes focus on practical and oral language skills\n\nApril 3, 2025\n|\nBy Johanne Cadorette\n[https://www.concordia.ca/news/authors/johanne-cadorette.html]\nShare on Facebook\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/facebook-round.png]\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-launches-new-french-language-courses-for-all-students.html\nShare on Twitter\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/twitter-round.png]\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-launches-new-french-language-courses-for-all-students.html\nShare on LinkedIn\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/linkedin-round.png]\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-launches-new-french-language-courses-for-all-students.html\nEmail this story\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/email-round.png]\n?subject=Concordia launches new French language courses for all\nstudents&body=Dynamic six-credit classes focus on practical and oral language\nskills%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.concordia.ca%2Fnews%2Fstories%2F2025%2F04%2F03%2Fconcordia-launches-new-french-language-courses-for-all-students.html\nA diverse group of four students in a small study library room\n[/news/stories/2025/04/03/concordia-launches-new-french-language-courses-for-all-students/_jcr_content/top-image.img.768.medium.jpg/1743703305914.jpg]\n\nThe Département d’études françaises [/fr/arts-sciences/francais.html] is\nintroducing a new series of language courses designed to give students more\noptions and flexibility to learn French. These courses are also open to all\nmembers of the Concordia community.\n\nWith a focus on comprehension and oral expression, the six-credit immersive\ncourses are intended for students from all disciplines.\n\n“Our goal is to provide students from outside Quebec with a viable, achievable\noption to progress in French while they complete their studies at Concordia.\nThese courses have a strong focus on the acquisition of oral language skills,”\nsays Pascale Sicotte\n[/artsci/about/leadership/office-dean/dean-of-arts-and-science.html], dean of\nthe Faculty of Arts and Sciences [/artsci.html].\n\n“They will also help students looking to combine their studies with work\nopportunities in Quebec, including internships, as well as make the most out of\ntheir time here.”\n\nThe courses are designed to be engaging and motivating. By focusing on the way\nFrench is spoken in Quebec, students will gain practical skills they can readily\napply in multiple contexts, like academic, professional or social situations.\n\nLearning is fast-tracked and oriented toward quick language acquisition through\nconcentrated exposure, improving fluency and retention. In-class interactions\nand online activities are designed to enhance engagement and reinforce skills.\nContinuous evaluation will facilitate progress and keep students motivated.\n\n\n‘FLEXIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE’\n\n“In designing these courses, we turned to the most current methods for the\nteaching of second languages and university pedagogy,” says Diane Querrien\n[/faculty/diane-querrien.html], directrice des programmes en langue, Études\nfrançaises.\n\n“We wanted the courses to be efficient and well-adapted to students’ needs. The\nimmersive format allows students to quickly complete the requirements, freeing\nup time during the year to prepare for study and work opportunities.”\n\nListed in the Undergraduate Calendar\n[/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current/section-31-faculty-of-arts-and-science/section-31-110-departement-d-etudes-francaises/cours-d-etudes-francaises.html]\nunder the new code FRAI (français immersif), the courses can be combined\nseamlessly with existing French (FRAN) courses. For example, students who\ncomplete the Immersive Beginner French (FRAI 201) course in the summer would\nmeet the requirements to enroll in the next level Français élémentaire immersif\n1(FRAI 202) or the FRAN 212 course in the fall.\n\nThe course sequence (FRAI 201, 202, 203, 204) will enable students to progress\non the Quebec scale of French proficiency (the Échelle québécoise des niveaux de\ncompétences en français) from a beginner level through to at least level five\nbefore graduating from Concordia. The series will be accessible starting in\nSummer 2025, with FRAI 201 and FRAI 202.\n\nFRAI courses offer a unique “success/no success” grading system, providing an\nincentive for students from various disciplines to learn French without\naffecting their grades or major studies. Students will still be able to enroll\nin FRAN courses, which have the usual grading system, if they would like their\ngrades to appear on their transcript.\n\n“With FRAI courses, we have introduced a complementary pathway within our\ndepartment that is both flexible and accessible.

The researchers say the phenomenon is directly linked to global\nwarming.\n\nThey add that the decline in snowpack in the Parc national de la Gaspésie’s\nmountains, which form the northern end of the Appalachian Mountain Range, has\nsignificant implications for water management and regional wildlife.\n\nThe study, led by PhD student Alexandre Pace\n[https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/research/loyola-sustainability/people/alexandrepace.html]\nand Jeannine-Marie St-Jacques\n[https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/jeanninemarie-stjacques.html], an associate\nprofessor in the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment\n[/artsci/geography-planning-environment.html], was published in the Journal of\nHydrology: Regional Studies\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581825000539]. Concordia\nPhD student Duane Noel and Guillaume Fortin of the Université de Moncton also\ncontributed.\n\nThe researchers created a tree ring record from samples gathered in the\nmountains, providing data dating back to 1822. This extends the historical\nknowledge well past the records established from instrumental readings, which\nonly captured data from the mid-20th century.\n\nTree rings in the region can be a natural indicator of snow melt: thinner rings\nare associated with springs that have a late-staying snow cover, thicker rings\nwith years of early thaw.\n\n“We found that big, extreme spring melt flows dropped off after 1937, indicating\na decline in winter snowpack in the mountains,” St-Jacques says. She adds that\nthe presence of young forests moving upslope is another indicator of longer\ngrowing seasons due to reduced snow coverage.\n\n\nTWO CENTURIES OF DATA\n\nThe tree ring samples were gathered from 13 sites around the intersection of the\nChic-Choc  and McGerrigle ranges, in areas that have never been clearcut by the\nforestry industry. The samples were collected in the summers of 2017, 2018 and\n2019 from cedars, spruce and firs, both living and dead. The samples were\npolished, scanned, digitally measured and crossdated using specialized software\nto ensure accuracy.\n\nThis comprehensive study makes the Sainte-Anne River only the fifth river basin\non the entire North American Atlantic seaboard to have its streamflow\nhistorically reconstructed based on tree rings. The others are the Hudson, the\nPotomac, the Delaware and the Santee in South Carolina.\n\nThe Sainte-Anne River records collected for this study align with historical\nstreamflow patterns seen in the records of the other four, with synchronous eras\nof drought and heavy precipitation.\n\n“We can see there are joint patterns of flow, whether it’s at high levels or\nlow,” she says. “As well, if you look at the instrumental records, we see that\nperiods of sustained low flow are about as common as periods of sustained high\nflow. But if we go back 200 years, we find that periods of low flow are more\ncommon, suggesting that water managers should plan for more lower-flow periods,\neven in this wet area.”\n\nThe researchers note that having a broad understanding of how the waterways of\nthe northeastern seaboard interact and share flow patterns can help authorities\nplan in the case of synchronous droughts in a future of more extreme climate\npatterns. \n\n\nBENEFITS FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS\n\nTree rings can hold clues that Hydro-Québec relies on to plan major projects.\nThe utility has done several tree ring reconstructions for its La Grande River\nhydroelectric projects that drain into James Bay and the La Romaine project on\nthe Côte-Nord, emptying into the St. Lawrence Estuary.\n\nBut the researchers point out that the Sainte-Anne River data can also be useful\nin other ways. It can give further insights into the role of declining snow\ncover in the decline of the Gaspésie caribou population, the only herd of its\nkind south of the St. Lawrence Estuary. It is also significant for Atlantic\nsalmon, which spawn in rivers but are experiencing significant population\nthreats in the southern parts of their range.\n\n“This project highlights the importance of protecting old growth forests,\nbecause that allows us to have these longer tree ring chronologies with which we\ncan reconstruct climate and understand environmental change. They give context\nto the changes we're seeing today,” Pace concludes.\n\nFunding for this study was provided by grants from the Natural Sciences and\nEngineering Research Council (NSERC)\n[https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp] Discovery Program and the Fonds de\nrecherche du Québec-Nature et technologies (FQRNT) [https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/].\n\nRead the cited paper: “Filling the Atlantic coastal tree-ring reconstruction\ngap: A 195-year record of growing season discharge of the Sainte-Anne River,\nGaspésie, Québec, Canada\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581825000539].”\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRELATED TOPICS\n\n\nresearch [/news/topic.html?topic=topics:general_interest/research]\ninfrastructure [/news/topic.html?topic=topics:research_subjects/infrastructure]\nclimate change [/news/topic.html?topic=topics:research_subjects/climate_change]\nResearch subjects [/news/topic.html?topic=topics:research_subjects]\nsustainability [/news/topic.html?topic=topics:research_subjects/sustainability]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShare on Facebook\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/facebook-round.png]\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/01/tree-rings-from-gaspesie-mountains-reveal-effects-of-global-warming-dating-back-almost-a-century.html\nShare on Twitter\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/twitter-round.png]\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/01/tree-rings-from-gaspesie-mountains-reveal-effects-of-global-warming-dating-back-almost-a-century.html\nShare on LinkedIn\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/linkedin-round.png]\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/01/tree-rings-from-gaspesie-mountains-reveal-effects-of-global-warming-dating-back-almost-a-century.html\nEmail this story\n[https://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/common/icons/social-media/email-round.png]\n?subject=Tree rings from Gaspésie mountains reveal effects of global warming\ndating back almost a century&body=Regional snowpack melt has been declining\nsince 1937, according to a new Concordia-led\nstudy%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.concordia.ca%2Fnews%2Fstories%2F2025%2F04%2F01%2Ftree-rings-from-gaspesie-mountains-reveal-effects-of-global-warming-dating-back-almost-a-century.html\n\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\n * Artificial intelligence can be used to predict river discharge and warn of\n   potential flooding, new Concordia study shows\n   [/news/stories/2024/11/19/artificial-intelligence-can-be-used-to-predict-river-discharge-and-warn-of-potential-flooding-new-concordia-study-shows.html]\n * The Arctic is the only ocean that has not seen a drop in legacy persistent\n   organic pollutants decades after global regulations, says new Concordia study\n   [/news/stories/2024/10/30/the-arctic-is-becoming-a-sink-for-the-world-oceans-legacy-pops-says-new-concordia-study.html]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/04/01/tree-rings-from-gaspesie-mountains-reveal-effects-of-global-warming-dating-back-almost-a-century.html","title":"Tree rings from Gaspésie mountains reveal effects of global warming dating back almost a century -

The plan\nenvisions expanded pedestrian zones, improved cycling infrastructure and\nstronger connections to public transit.\n\n“Our community told us that mobility is key to an improved campus experience,”\nDumont explains. “That’s why the plan — in collaboration with Montreal’s\nmobility partners — prioritizes sustainable mobility and ease of movement for\nstudents, faculty and staff.”\n\nEnhancing outdoor spaces\n[/offices/facilities/campus-master-plan/scenarios/outdoor-spaces.html] is also a\nkey priority. The plan outlines strategies to enrich the environmental quality\nof both campuses through tree canopies, gardens and biodiversity initiatives.\n\nPlazas and courtyards could be revitalized to create inviting and inclusive\nspaces for learning, socializing and relaxation, with improved seating, lighting\nand wayfinding making these areas more functional and welcoming year-round.\n\n“Well-designed outdoor spaces don’t just improve aesthetics — they shape how we\nexperience campus,” says Carvajo Lucena.\n\nThe plan also emphasizes modernizing both indoor and outdoor spaces\n[/offices/facilities/campus-master-plan/scenarios/indoor-outdoor-space-design.html]\nto create flexible, future-ready environments.

Humanity is at major\ncross-roads, in which the culture and policies around advanced digital tools\nlike AI, IoT, and big data may shape our trajectory on science-based\nsustainability targets for years to come. They also stand to continue to be used\npredominantly as tools of business efficiency, while their potential for\naddressing social inequities remain untapped. Meanwhile, the problems of waste\nand material consumption are continuing to grow, with global waste projected to\nnearly double by 2050.\n\nHosted by Concordia ’24-’25 Public Scholar, Faisal Shennib\n[https://www.concordia.ca/gradstudies/professional-skills/public-scholars/profiles/faisal-shennib.html],\nthis event begins with a panel discussion on how digitization, community\nengagement, and policy can come together to help communities reach zero waste,\nincluding at Concordia University, as well as on the hazards of blindly\nembracing more technology to solve the waste and resource consumption crisis.\nFollowing this, we’ll invite users to engage with technology for sustainability\ndeveloped through the OpenWaste.ai project, while asking them to imagine the\nsocial implications of the technology and the way it can be harnessed for a\nfuture of collective justice.\n\nHow can you participate?

Do not confuse the dates\nyou see in the examples in this guide with the actual current term dates and\ninformation.\n\nSTEP 1 — ACADEMIC ADVISING\n\n\nACADEMIC ADVISING\n\nHolds box screenshot\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel/parsys-accordion/textimage/image.img.png/1613490610193.png]\n\nThe requirements for advising prior to registration vary according to your\nprogram of study. To determine if you require advising refer to the Holds box on\nyour Student Center page or go to your Faculty or School’s advising information\npage by clicking on the appropriate link below.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvisor screenshot\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel/parsys-accordion/textimage_843356848/image.img.png/1613490643767.png]\n\nHow to contact your academic advisor:\n\nIn most cases, you will be assigned an academic advisor for your main plan of\nstudy and potentially for any additional plans that you may have. You can easily\nsee the advisor information from the homepage of your student centre:\n\n\n\nThis displays the name of your individual advisor or advising team along with\ntheir contact telephone number (if available). If you click on the “details”\nlink, you will see a breakdown of which advisor or advising team relates to each\nof your plans.\n\nAdvisor's name screenshot\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel/parsys-accordion/image.img.png/1614360324769.png]\n\nIf available, and depending on the email program you are using, you can click on\nthe link where the name of the advisor or advising team is shown. This will\nallow you to email your advisor. If there is no link, then no email address has\nbeen provided and you should use the contact phone number to reach your advisor.\n\nNOTE: If you are using an internet email client such as Gmail, you can hover the\ncursor over the link and the email address will be displayed in the bottom left\nof your screen. Alternatively, depending on the browser you are using, you can\nright-click on the link and select ‘copy email address’. You may then paste the\naddress into your email client.\n\nYou can also get more information about advising from the links below:\n\n   »  Arts and Science\n[/students/registration/advising/artsandscience-advising.html]    »  John Molson\nSchool of Business\n[/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/students/advising-policies/academic-advising.html]\n   »  Engineering and Computer Science\n[/students/registration/advising/encs-advising.html]    »  Fine Arts\n[/finearts/academics/advising.html]    »  Independent students\n[/students/registration/advising/independent-student-advising.html]\n\nSTEP 2 — ACCESSING REGISTRATION\n\nRegister for courses.\n[https://campus.concordia.ca/psc/pscsprd/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/SA_LEARNER_SERVICES.SSR_SSENRL_CART.GBL?Page=SSR_SSENRL_CART&Action=A&ExactKeys=Y&TargetFrameName=None]\n\nYou can also find the link to register on to the Student Hub's My CU Account\n[https://hub.concordia.ca/students/account.html?category=academic] page.\n\nIf you are on a mobile device or a tablet, click the Enroll tile to begin your\nregistration process.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_977680764/parsys-accordion/image.img.png/1613497654634.png]\n\n\nIf you are using a desktop, you can access the enrollment functions from the\nleft-hand navigation Enrollment dropdown or by clicking on Enroll on the right.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_977680764/parsys-accordion/image_1048988675.img.png/1614360252066.png]\nSTEP 3 — PLAN YOUR TIMETABLE\n\nTo assist you in planning your timetable we have included information on how to\nlook for courses three different ways:\n\nA – USE THE CONCORDIA CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER\n\nThe Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a\nworkable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class\nschedule.\n\nB – USE THE CLASS SEARCH\n\nYou can search for a range of classes based on specific criteria you can define.\n\nC – BROWSE THE COURSE CATALOG\n\nThis is a comprehensive listing of courses offered at Concordia University.\n\nPlease note the following:\n\nTEST RESULTS\n\n * If you plan on registering for English Composition or ESL (English as a\n   Second Language) courses and have written the appropriate placement test,\n   your results will be sent to you by e-mail.\n   \n   \n\nREQUISITES\n\n\n * Pre-requisites – These are usually either specific classes you must have\n   taken or a minimum number of completed credits before you can register for a\n   given class.\n   \n * Co-requisites – These are classes that need to be taken at the same time (or\n   previously) to be able to register for a given class.\n   \n * Anti-requisites – These are other classes for which you must not have\n   previously received credit (including any transfer credit or exemptions) to\n   register for a given class. For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of\n   MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken\n   and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements\n   are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level\n   course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar\n   content.\n\nYou should consult the Undergraduate Calendar\n[/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current.html] to see the requisites for the\ncourse in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites\nnot met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have\nmet all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you\nbelieve that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB\nstudents, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they\ncan look into this matter for you.\n\n * Degree/Certificate students: You are not permitted to register for a course\n   that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you\n   have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course\n   without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will\n   permit you access to the course.\n   \n * Independent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the\n   prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “Prerequisite\n   Waiver Form” and receive approval prior to registering. Note that you must\n   include specific details of the course, including the course name and number,\n   where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and\n   transcripts. This form is available at the Birks Student Service Centre\n   [/students/birks.html]. (also available at Student requests & forms\n   [/admissions/independent-students/accepted-independent/forms.html])\n   \n\nRESERVE SEATS IN CLASSES\n\nSome classes have seats reserved for students in specific programs. This is\nusually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program\ncan register in it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers\nthe class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats as reserved. If you try\nto register for a class and receive a message about “reserved seats” then you\nshould select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate\nStudent Affairs Office, for JMSB students\n[/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/contact-us.html] to obtain permission to\ntake the class.\n\n\nDEPARTMENT CONSENT\n\nSome classes may require that you first obtain department permission to take the\nclass. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you\nwill need to speak to the department that offers the class to obtain permission\nto register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student\nAffairs Office [/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/contact-us.html].\n\n         A — USE THE CONCORDIA CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER\n\nThe Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a\nworkable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class\nschedule.\n\nNote that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to\nadd courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to\nfollow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A – Adding Classes.\n\nYou can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places\nin your student centre:\n\n1.

It would be necessary for you\nto contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent. In other\ninstances, you may be denied registration in a course that appears to have seats\navailable. This is caused by the Department/Faculty having reserved seats for\nstudents in a particular department or program of study.\n\nRemember to register for all terms Summer, Fall, Fall/Winter and Winter at the\nsame time – do not wait until later in the Fall to register for your Winter\ncourses as you may find them filled to capacity.\n\n         B — DROPPING CLASSES\n\nPlease note: If you only want to change sections of the same course, see Step 6,\nC – Swapping classes.\n\nThere are three easy steps to dropping a class from your schedule but there are\ntwo different types of course withdrawals and both are controlled by deadline\ndates shown in the Term Dates and Deadlines\n[/students/registration/term-dates-deadlines.html].\n\nPlease note the following important details:\n\n * DNE – did not enter – The DNE date is generally one to two weeks after the\n   first day of classes. A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is\n   treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your\n   student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other\n   fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will\n   receive financial credit for course fees.\n * DISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. An academic\n   withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date\n   allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the\n   DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of\n   DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of\n   tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course.\n * Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw,\n   does not constitute an official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to\n   a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping\n   the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of\n   a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade.\n * If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter\n   course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will\n   run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students\n   registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that\n   prerequisite.\n * Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the\n   option to select that term.\n * If you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will\n   not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a\n   new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared.\n * For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the\n   Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the\n   Student Center page.\n\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop\n\nNOTE: If you receive an error message stating “You are not authorized for self\nservice enrollment at this time” when you click on the Drop tab, you will need\nto click the “change term” button and then follow the steps below.\n\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the\ntable.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1499294451/parsys-accordion/textimage_1/image.img.png/1613432244320.png]\n\n\n\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be\navailable for selection from the table.\n\nClick the Continue button.\n\nAll registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid.

The\nprocess is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify\nthe availability of another course or section of the same course before you make\na decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if\nanother section is not available. \n\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a\nsection change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for\nand then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be\nable to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another\nstudent may have taken your place once you dropped the course.\n\nThere are some restrictions attached to swapping classes:\n\n * If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until\n   you clear the hold.\n * Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term. \n * For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the\n   Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the\n   Student Center page.\n * If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap\n   classes.\n * The swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in\n   different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to\n   June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to\n   August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course.\n\nTo swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the\nother components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A,\nConf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping\nMulti-Component Classes.\n\n\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap\n\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the\ntable.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_1/image.img.png/1613432740641.png]\n\n\n\nClick the Continue button.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage/image.img.png/1613432740930.png]\n\n\n\nThe first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes\nin which you are currently enrolled.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_3/image.img.png/1613432740774.png]\n\n\n\nThe next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using\nthe class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the\nClass Nbr if you already know it.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_4/image.img.png/1613432740811.png]\n\n\n\nSelect the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid.\n\nSelect the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid.\n\nIf you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose\nthe section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then\nre-directed to the Confirm your selection page.\n\nIf you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option\ntakes you to the Confirm your selection page.\n\nIf you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach\nthe Confirm your selection page.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_5/image.img.png/1613432741066.png]\n\n\n\nConfirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_8/image.img.png/1613432727351.png]\n\n\n\nIf the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message\nor try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_10/image.img.png/1613433263319.png]\n\n\n\nView My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_11/image.img.png/1613433263780.png]\n\n\n\nSWAPPING MULTI-COMPONENT CLASSES (WHILE KEEPING ONE OR MORE OF THE OTHER\nCOMPONENTS)\n\n 1. Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid.\n    You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if\n    you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled.\n 2. Confirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed.\n 3. Verify the swap transaction.\n 4. View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your\n    registration.\n    \n    PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that\n    is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL\n    components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you\n    do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap\n    components if your preferred component is on a waitlist.\n    \n    For example:\n    You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and\n    Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap\n    the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this\n    using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA\n    and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U\n    UB and Laboratory UI-X.\n\n         D — WAIT LISTING CLASSES\n\nOnce all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to\nadd your name to a wait list.

You have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat\n    becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for\n    that term.\n 2. You have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a\n    wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available,\n    you would swap one course for another.\n    \n\nSCENARIO 1\n\nYou start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 201 but the\ncourse is full and you get the following error message:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_1/image.img.png/1613433263576.png]\n\n\n\nYou use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and\ndetermine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to\nadd your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box\nlabelled Wait list if class is full and select next.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_2/image.img.png/1613433263162.png]\n\n\n\nYou will see the resulting message:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_3/image.img.png/1613433263168.png]\n\n\n\nIf a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements\nyou will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The\nregistration in this course could take place as late as one day before the\ndeadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty.\n\nSCENARIO 2\n\nIf you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have\nalready reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE\n123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses\nyou would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the\ncourse. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you\nidentify that you want to “Wait list if class is full”.\n\nIf a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements\nyou will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via\ne-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as\none day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty.\n\nSOME TIPS ABOUT WAIT LISTS\n\n 1. You can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term.\n 2. You cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course.\n 3.

An amount may show as ‘Due now’ before the final payment\n   deadline. For example, the tuition fees for a Fall term are generally due at\n   the beginning of September but you are allowed until the end of September to\n   pay them without financial penalty. These fees will show as ‘Due Now’ in your\n   Student Centre from the beginning of September.\n   \n   \n * Future Due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming\n   term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any\n   upcoming term(s). For example, if you are enrolling in Winter classes before\n   the beginning of January, the tuition fees for these classes will show as\n   ‘Future Due’ in your Student Centre until the beginning of January.\n    \n\nPLEASE NOTE – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you\nwould like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “Account\nInquiry” link in the top-left of the Finances section.  This will trigger a\nrecalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly.\n\nFor more information about tuition fees and payment deadlines, please visit the\nTuition and Fees [/students/financial/tuition-fees.html]page.\n\n* $90 Late registration fee\nUndergraduate Students who register between the first day of class and the last\nday to register will be charged a Late Registration fee.

university’s founding institutions continue until today.\n\nLocated in the vibrant and multicultural City of Montreal, Concordia University\nplaces among the top-ranked

the largest urban universities in\nCanada.\n\n\nTHIS IS OUR STORY\n\nWhile Concordia’s next-generation thinking [/next-gen.html] allows it to\nconstantly look forward, its roots are firmly planted in two distinctive\ninstitutions of higher education, both with illustrious histories. The\nuniversity was officially founded on August 24, 1974, following the merger of\nLoyola College and Sir George Williams University.\n\nConcordia adopted its name from Montreal’s motto, Concordia salus, which means\n“well-being through harmony.”\n\n\n\n\nFOUNDING INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe university’s core values, including a commitment to contributing to\nimproving individuals and society, stem from those long prized by Loyola and Sir\nGeorge Williams.\n\n\nLOYOLA COLLEGE\n\nLoyola College grew out of the English-language program of Collège Sainte-Marie,\na Jesuit college founded in 1848. Loyola College became a separate institution\nin 1896. Loyola was first located in downtown Montreal before it relocated to\nland it acquired in 1900 in the city’s west end. The college moved into the\nthree original buildings on the current Loyola Campus in 1916.\n\nLearn more [/offices/archives/stories/loyola.html]\n[/content/concordia/en/about/history/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container_463537260/grid-container-parsys/image.img.jpg/1712174577414.jpg]\nCentral Building on Loyola Campus, Feb. 1988\n\n\nSIR GEORGE WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY\n\nSir George Williams University originated in the evening classes offered by a\nYMCA Educational Program that began in 1851 and continued in various YMCA\nfacilities in downtown Montreal. The program became a co-educational college in\n1926, introducing university-level courses in 1929. Sir George Williams\nconferred its first university degrees in 1936 and earned its university charter\n— under which Concordia currently grants degrees — in 1948.\n\nVisit Records Management and Archives\n[http://www.concordia.ca/offices/archives.html] to read more of the history of\nConcordia, Loyola and Sir George Williams.\n\nLearn more [/offices/archives/stories/sgw.html]\n[/content/concordia/en/about/history/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container_640504172/grid-container-parsys/image.img.jpg/1712174852116.jpg]\nBishop Court before the construction of the J.W. McConnell Building\n\n\n\nSTEADY GROWTH\n\nThroughout its history, Concordia has experienced steady and impressive growth\nin enrolment, number of faculty and staff, and research.\n\nBy the 2023-24 academic year, student enrolment stood at 49,714, more than\ndouble the number at Concordia’s founding.\n\nConcordia has received more than $35 million in Canada Foundation for Innovation\nfunding since the Government of Canada created the program in 1997 to support\nCanadian research infrastructure.\n\nIn 2000, the Canadian government initiated the Canada Research Chair Program to\nestablish 2,000 research professorships across the country.

This series is part of Concordia’s 50th\nanniversary, and will be a monthly rendez-vous from September 2024 to May 2025\nat Cinéma du Musée. Nine feature films were curated by Dr. Martin Lefebvre,\nProfessor and Research Chair in Film Studies at Concordia’s Mel Hoppenheim\nSchool of Cinema, and Jean-François Lamarche, Head of programming at Cinémas\nBeaubien, du Parc et du Musée. The selected films offer a portrait of cinema in\n1974 and 1975 in Quebec, in North America and abroad. The mid-’70s were a key\nperiod in the evolution of film, as art-house cinema started occupying a greater\nplace amongst the blockbusters of the era. The film cycle showcases films that\nwere critically acclaimed upon release, as well as lesser-known, sometimes\nforgotten yet influential titles that deserve to be rediscovered by cinephiles.\n\"What became the Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema was born at a time when\ninternational film culture was extremely rich. Screening the great films that\nour students and professors discovered while they themselves participated in the\ndevelopment of a film culture in our city seems like the best way to celebrate\nour 50th anniversary.\" – Dr. Martin Lefebvre 1974-75 : Cinquante ans de cinéma à\nConcordia\n\nWhen\nSeptember 22, 2024 – May 11, 2025 (all day)\nWhere\nCinema du musée\nSpeaker(s)\nVarious\nMore info\n[/cuevents/finearts/cinema/2024/11/27/celebrating-concordia-and-cinema-1974-750.html]\nOFF topics:academic_disciplines/film, topics:academic_disciplines/filmmaking,\nconcordia-events-categories:arts-culture,\nconcordia-events-categories:arts-culture/films event-audiences:all\nevent-audiences:concordia-community event-audiences:concordia-community/students\nUNTIL MAY 23\nFIL CONDUCTEUR\n\nThe FOFA Gallery is pleased to present Fil conducteur, an exhibition of\ncontemporary Indigenous beadwork by artists Carrie Allison, Katherine Boyer, Bev\nKoski, Jean Marshall, and Nico Williams.\n\nWhen\nMarch 17, 2025 – May 23, 2025 (all day)\nWhere\nSir George Williams Campus Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts\nIntegrated Complex [/maps/sgw-campus.html?building=EV] EV.1-715 (1515 St.\nCatherine W.)\nMore info [/cuevents/finearts/fofa/2025/03/17/fil-conducteur.html]\nSGW concordia-events-categories:arts-culture/exhibitions event-audiences:all\nevent-audiences:concordia-community/students\nevent-audiences:concordia-community/staff\nevent-audiences:concordia-community/faculty\nUNTIL MAY 27\nQUEBEC SCIENTIFIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM\n\nWhere will your research take you?

However, the term\nhas since gained momentum and is now used to describe the snowballing effects of\nmicroaggressions and other negative racially charged experiences of people of\ncolour. Smith defines Racial Battle Fatigue as the “cumulative result of a\nnatural race-related stress response to distressing mental and emotional\nconditions. These conditions emerged from constantly facing racially dismissive,\ndemeaning, insensitive and/or hostile racial environments and individuals”\n(Smith et al. 2011).

Students are encouraged to contact the Financial Aid and Awards\nOffice directly with questions about their eligibility for particular\nscholarships and bursaries, at fundingyoureducation@concordia.ca\n[fundingyoureducation@concordia.ca].\n\n \n\nA very small number of scholarships and bursaries are open to part-time\nstudents, or do not have a full-time restriction. For these, the Undergraduate\nAwards Office will perform a registration check; however, there may be some\nflexibility regarding the student's credit load.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nENTRANCE SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nEntrance Scholarships are awarded to new admission candidates on the basis of\ntop Cegep grades or equivalent (Canadian high school etc.). In the Faculty of\nFine Arts, most Entrance Scholarships are issued on the basis of portfolios.\nOnly selected candidates are notified.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nENTRANCE BURSARIES\n\nEntrance bursaries are awarded by the Financial Aid and Awards Office to\nnewly-admitted students following an application-based competition that includes\na financial need test and holistic committee review. Applicants are notified of\nthe results after the Financial Aid and Awards Office receives results from the\nbursary committee.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN-COURSE SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nIn-course scholarships are awarded automatically by the Undergraduate\nScholarships and Awards Committee on the basis of top Assessment GPA (4.30).\nOnly selected candidates are notified.\n\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN-COURSE BURSARIES \n\nIn-course bursaries are awarded by the Financial Aid and Awards Office to\npreviously admitted students following an application-based competition that\nincludes a financial need test and holistic committee review. Applicants to the\nIn-Course Bursary program must be in acceptable academic standing with a minimum\nAssessment GPA of at least 2.00. Applicants are notified of the results after\nthe Financial Aid and Awards Office receives results from the bursary\ncommittee. \n\n\nONE AWARD POLICY\n\nPlease note that you may hold only one (1) of the following types of Concordia\nawards during a given academic year:\n\n \n\n * Entrance Scholarships\n * Entrance Bursaries\n * In-Course Scholarships\n * In-Course Bursaries\n\nThis policy ensures that as many students as possible will receive a\nscholarship, bursary, or award each academic year.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXCEPTIONS\n\n * You may hold more than one of these awards if authorised by the Undergraduate\n   Scholarships and Awards Committee.\n * You may hold any number of external awards in addition to your scholarship or\n   bursary.\n\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS AND FUNDING PAYMENTS\n\nPayments for all types of scholarships, bursaries, and awards are processed in\nthe Student Information System.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe scholarship, bursary, or award funds are electronically transferred directly\nto the recipient's account at Concordia University. The system will\nautomatically apply the transferred funds towards any tuition/fees still owing.\n\n \n\nIn the event that a recipient has already paid their tuition and fees at the\ntime an award payment is posted to their account at Concordia, they can either\nleave the credit on account and the system will automatically apply it towards\nfuture tuition/fees at a later date, or they can request a refund cheque from\nthe Student Accounts Office via their MyConcordia Student Center.\n\n \n\nScholarships, bursaries and awards are a means of financial support for students\nwho are admitted or enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree/program. Repayment of these\nfunds is not required.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRENEWING SCHOLARSHIPS AND BURSARIES\n\nThe majority of scholarships and bursaries are not renewable. For the few that\nare renewable, each year the Undergraduate Awards Office reviews recipients'\nrecords to check for renewal criteria, which are usually continuing full-time\nstatus and acceptable Grade Point Average. Notification will be sent to the\nrecipient by e-mail to confirm that the renewal is on track, or that there is a\nproblem preventing the renewal (e.g. GPA too low).\n\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRECIPIENTS OF GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS, SCHOLARSHIPS OR AWARDS\n\nFor information on fellowship, scholarship and award payments administered by\nthe Graduate Awards Office, School of Graduate Studies, please visit their\nwebsite.\n\n \n\nGraduate award holder information\n[/gradstudies/funding/award-holder-information.html]\n\nUSEFUL LINKS\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccess your student account\n[https://campus.concordia.ca/psp/pscsprd/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/SA_LEARNER_SERVICES.SSF_SS_PAYMENT.GBL?PORTALPARAM_PTCNAV=HC_SF_PAYMENT_GBL1&EOPP.SCNode=SA&EOPP.SCPortal=EMPLOYEE&EOPP.SCName=ADMN_APPSIAN_FINANCE&EOPP.SCLabel=&EOPP.SCPTcname=ADMN_SC_SP_APPSIAN_FINANCE&FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.PORTAL_BASE_DATA.CO_NAVIGATION_COLLECTIONS.ADMN_APPSIAN_FINANCE.ADMN_S202006041630392102456936&IsFolder=false]\nCLAIMING SCHOLARSHIPS AND FUNDING FOR YOUR TAXES\n\nAll scholarship and bursary funds received must be reported on your tax return\nin the appropriate section.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe university will issue a T4A tax slip for this purpose.

Each committee will be\ncomprised of representatives of the relevant community and/or internal subject\nmatter experts who will review the applications and provide support to awards\nadjudications committees.\n\nIn general, minimum requirements for awards meant for underrepresented students\ncan include:\n\n 1. Applicants self-identifying as a member of the underrepresented group for\n    which the award is meant. In addition, a brief statement is normally\n    required detailing lived experiences as an underrepresented community member\n    at the time of application and/or at the time of award adjudication. The\n    term underrepresented group, refers to members of groups whose\n    representation in a community does not reflect local and national\n    demographic diversity. Examples of underrepresented groups include\n    Indigenous communities, racialized groups, women, persons with disabilities,\n    members of the 2SLGBTQ+ communities, and religious minority groups.\n 2. In assessing an award or nomination, additional documents and/or further\n    validation processes may be required depending on the community for which\n    the award is meant.\n 3.

You will need to contact your\nfinancial institution to make a repayment agreement or request a grace period\nfor your payment (also called a ‘partial exemption period’ or a ‘payment\npostponement’).\n\nSome loan providers will send you a repayment agreement by mail with the option\nto set up a pre-authorized debit. This will allow your financial institution to\nautomatically withdraw the payment every month from your bank account.\n\nIn some provinces and territories, federal and provincial/territorial student\nloans are issued separately. This means that you could have more than one loan\naccount and more than one loan issuer to arrange payments with. Please be sure\nto contact each loan provider to arrange to repay them. Make sure you keep them\nup to date on any changes to your address or phone number to avoid any delay in\nreceiving critical information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRETURNING STUDENTS\n\nGoing back to school? Once you have been accepted and registered, contact the\nFinancial Aid and Awards Office for information on the funding options available\nto you. If you are returning as a full-time student, you may also be eligible\nfor interest-free status during your periods of study. Let us know so that we\ncan advise your loan provider.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRETURNING STUDENTS\n\nGoing back to school? Once you have been accepted and registered, contact the\nFinancial Aid and Awards Office for information on the funding options available\nto you. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are returning as a full-time student, you may also be eligible for\ninterest-free status during your periods of study. Let us know so that we can\nadvise your loan provider.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAST DUE PAYMENTS\n\n * Your total income and expenses should be two separate sums. Budgeting is to\n   improve your financial situation by having more income than expenses. \n * If your expenses are greater than your total income, you will need to\n   consider making changes to balance your budget. This will mean cutting some\n   expenses.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSEQUENCES FOR LATE OR NON-PAYMENT\n\nContact your loan provider before your payment is past due to set up a payment\narrangement. Most student loan programs give you a period of at least 6 months\nafter you graduate before you must start making payments. This is known as a\ngrace or partial exemption period. This means that you have 6 months from end of\nyour last full-time study period until your first student loan payment is due.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring this time, your payment options are as follows:\n\n\nDefer all payments – The interest that has accumulated during the partial\nexemption period will be added to the loan principal and paid in accordance with\nyour loan agreement.\n\nRepay the interest only – During the 6 month exemption period you can pay the\ninterest only each month so that it does not accumulate; your debt will not\nchange. Once the six months are up, you will repay your loan principal and\ninterest.\n\nVisit the Repayment section of you student loan provider’s website for more\ninformation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCONSEQUENCES FOR LATE OR NON-PAYMENT\n\n\nThere are serious consequences if you don’t pay or miss payments on your loans\nwhich may include:\n\n * Your credit rating maybe negatively affected\n * Your loans may be sent to a collection agency\n * Any GST or income tax refunds you are eligible to receive will be\n   automatically used to repay your defaulted loans\n * The government may seizing your salary, furniture and/or property\n * You may lose your eligibility for further student loans\n\n\n\n\nNOTICES & UPDATES\n\nOSAP- Summer 2025 Application\n\n[/cunews/offices/provost/faao/2025/04/OSAP-SummerApplication.html]\nMarch 31, 2025\n\nFiling a United States income tax return\n\n[/cunews/offices/provost/faao/2025/03/2024-us-income-tax-returns.html]\nMarch 4, 2025\n\nAlberta 2024 T4A income tax information\n\n[/cunews/offices/provost/faao/2025/02/2024-t4a-income-tax-information.html]\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\nAide financière aux études 2024 T4A income tax information\n\n[/cunews/offices/provost/faao/2025/02/afe-2024-t4a-income-tax-information.html]\nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEXPLORE OTHER FUNDING OPTIONS\n\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS\n\nReview the availability, eligibility and selection process of undergraduate\nentrance and in-course scholarships.\n\nFind eligible scholarships\n[/students/financial/scholarships-funding/scholarships.html]\n\n\nBURSARIES\n\nApply to the in-course or entrance bursary program to access financial-needs\nbased funding.\n\nApply to the bursary program\n[/students/financial/scholarships-funding/bursaries.html]\n\n\nSTUDENT EMPLOYMENT\n\nLearn about job opportunities avialble on and off campus including the\nwork-study program.\n\nSearch student employment opportunities\n[/students/financial/scholarships-funding/awards.html]\n\n\nBOOK AN APPOINTMENT TO DISCUSS STUDENT AID.\n\nAn advisor will reply within 1-2 business days.\n\nWhen submitting your request for an appointment, please include the following:\n\n * Your student ID number\n * First and last name\n * The reason for your appointment\n\nBook an appointment [fundingyoureducation@concordia.ca]\n[/content/concordia/en/students/financial/loans/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container_791470141/grid-container-parsys/image.img.jpg/1684259132990.jpg]","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/students/financial/loans.html","title":"Loans - Concordia University","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"STUDY AT CONCORDIA\n\nAttend an info session\n[https://go.concordia.ca/events/upcoming-events-list/?contact-type=prospect%20student&contact-group=graduate]\n\n\n\n\nPursue a master’s, PhD, diploma or certificate at Concordia to apply your skills\nboth creatively and practically.\n\nEXPLORE OUR GRADUATE PROGRAMS\n[/gradstudies/future-students/programs/discover-our-programs.html]\nHOW TO APPLY [/gradstudies/future-students/how-to-apply.html]\n\n\nDISCOVER WHY CONCORDIA IS RIGHT FOR YOUR GRADUATE JOURNEY\n\n\n\n[/content/concordia/en/gradstudies/future-students/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container_1813887584/grid-container-parsys/offset_block_1147348481/adaptiveimage.img.full.medium.jpg/1708542869158.jpg]\n\n\n\nEMPOWERING PURPOSE\n\nStudy and live in one of North America’s top student cities.

Academic advisors are here to help you progress through your degree at\nConcordia.\n\nJump to:\n\n * Types of academic advisors \n * Preparing for an advising appointment \n * Essential academic resources \n * Undergraduate advising & registration videos \n * Other types of support \n * Graduate advising \n\n\n\n\nTYPES OF ACADEMIC ADVISORS\n\nAs a Concordia student, you have access to program-, department- and\nfaculty-level advising, to make sure you speak to the professors and staff best\npositioned to give you the right advice.\n\nAcademic advice  can vary — even for students in the same program or faculty.\nIt’s important to connect with your academic advisor to get personalized answers\nto your questions. Find your main advisor’s contact information in your Student\nCentre [https://campus.concordia.ca/].\n\nDepending on your program, you may also have access to additional advisors who\ncan answer your questions and assist with academic planning.\n\nFACULTY LEVEL\n\nEach Faculty has a Student Academic Services (SAS) or Undergraduate Student\nAffairs office staffed with full-time professional advisors.\n\nFaculty-level advisors are “big-picture” academic advisors. They are full-time\nprofessional staff, unlike professors, who divide their time between advising,\nteaching and research. They are experts in the academic rules and regulations\nthat all students in a given faculty need to follow. \n\nFor example: if you are working towards a Bachelor of Arts with a major in\npsychology, a faculty-level advisor can ensure that you meet all degree\nrequirements as stipulated by the Faculty of Arts and Science, not just the\nrequirements for your major. \n\nFaculty-level advisors can also advise on a wide range of topics including:\n\n * General degree requirements (i.e., BA, BAdmin, BEng)\n * Elective courses\n * Transfer credits\n * Faculty-wide regulations\n * Student requests (exceptions to academic regulations)\n * Internal degree transfers and changes in concentration\n * Study abroad opportunities\n * Academic options for students facing extenuating circumstances\n\nADVISING WEB PAGES BY FACULTY\n\n * Faculty of Arts and Science [/artsci/students/sas.html]\n * Faculty of Fine Arts [/finearts/academics/advising.html]\n * Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science\n   [/ginacody/students/academic-services.html]\n * John Molson School of Business\n   [/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/students/advising-policies/academic-advising.html]\n * Independent students\n   [/admissions/independent-students/accepted-independent.html]\n\nDEPARTMENT LEVEL\n\nDepartmental advisors may be faculty members or administrative staff.

Will this course count towards my program?\n   How do I change programs? How do I take a course in another faculty/School?\n   Which term can I graduate in? Make sure you're ready to take notes for your\n   future reference.\n\n * Consult your faculty’s advising web page\n   [/students/registration/advising.html#faculty-advising] for the next steps\n   specific to your situation. Each Faculty, School and/or department has its\n   own advising policies and procedures, so your next steps may be different\n   from your friends’.\n\n * Read about your program and its requirements in the Undergraduate Calendar\n   [/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current.html] to learn more about the\n   courses you are required to complete in order to earn your degree.\n\n * Visit your department’s web page to see if a degree planning or course\n   sequencing worksheet is available for your program, and if so, fill it out to\n   the best of your ability before your advising appointment.\n   * Arts and Science: academic department web pages\n     [/artsci/programs/departments.html] and department advisors\n     [/artsci/programs/departments.html]\n   * Fine Arts: academic program guides\n     [/finearts/academics/advising/program-guides.html]\n   * Gina Cody: course sequences by department\n     [/ginacody/students/academic-services/undergraduate/course-sequences.html]\n   * John Molson: program planning worksheets\n     [/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/students/course-registration/worksheets.html]\n\n * Get familiar with the essential academic resources below.\n\n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nESSENTIAL ACADEMIC RESOURCES\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/advising/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container_18774801/grid-container-parsys/image.img.jpg/1644442853560.jpg]\n\n\nBASIC ACADEMIC TERMINOLOGY\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour undergraduate student lexicon\n[/students/registration/advising/your-undergraduate-student-lexicon.html]\nWhat’s a prerequisite?\n[/students/registration/advising/prerequisite-courses.html]\nThe scoop on full- & part-time status\n[/students/registration/advising/full-part-status.html]\nGPA – what does it mean?

For example, MARK495 is an anti-requisite of\n   MARK301. To register for MARK301, students should not have previously taken\n   and received credit for MARK495. The reason for these types of requirements\n   are to stop students taking courses out of sequence or taking a higher level\n   course and then trying to take a lower level course that may have similar\n   content.\n\nYou should consult the Undergraduate Calendar\n[/academics/undergraduate/calendar/current.html] to see the requisites for the\ncourse in which you want to register. If you receive a message about ‘requisites\nnot met’ when trying to register for a class, you should ensure that you have\nmet all of the requisites as stated in the Undergraduate Calendar. If you\nbelieve that you have then you will need to speak to your department (JMSB\nstudents, please contact the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office) so that they\ncan look into this matter for you.\n\n * Degree/Certificate students: You are not permitted to register for a course\n   that has a prerequisite if you have not completed that prerequisite. If you\n   have received authorization from an academic advisor to register for a course\n   without the stated prerequisite, the advisor must enter a waiver that will\n   permit you access to the course.\n   \n * Independent/Visiting students: If you wish to register for courses where the\n   prerequisite was completed elsewhere, you must complete a “Prerequisite\n   Waiver Form” and receive approval prior to registering. Note that you must\n   include specific details of the course, including the course name and number,\n   where and when it was completed, as well as the course description and\n   transcripts. This form is available at the Birks Student Service Centre\n   [/students/birks.html]. (also available at Student requests & forms\n   [/admissions/independent-students/accepted-independent/forms.html])\n   \n\nRESERVE SEATS IN CLASSES\n\nSome classes have seats reserved for students in specific programs. This is\nusually done to ensure that students who need the class as part of their program\ncan register in it. Depending on the rules defined by the department that offers\nthe class, they may set all, some, or none of the seats as reserved. If you try\nto register for a class and receive a message about “reserved seats” then you\nshould select another class or consult the department or the Undergraduate\nStudent Affairs Office, for JMSB students\n[/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/contact-us.html] to obtain permission to\ntake the class.\n\n\nDEPARTMENT CONSENT\n\nSome classes may require that you first obtain department permission to take the\nclass. If you receive a message that states: “Department Consent Required”, you\nwill need to speak to the department that offers the class to obtain permission\nto register. JMSB students will need to contact the Undergraduate Student\nAffairs Office [/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/contact-us.html].\n\n         A — USE THE CONCORDIA CLASS SCHEDULE BUILDER\n\nThe Concordia Class Schedule Builder is a tool to assist you to generate a\nworkable personalized class schedule with ease based on the published class\nschedule.\n\nNote that the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to\nadd courses directly to your enrollment course cart. You will then need to\nfollow the instructions further down this page in Step 6A – Adding Classes.\n\nYou can access the Concordia Class Schedule Builder from four different places\nin your student centre:\n\n1.

It would be necessary for you\nto contact the relevant Department to obtain the necessary consent.

A withdrawal (drop) before the DNE deadline date is\n   treated as if you were never in the course. There will be no entry on your\n   student record for that course and you will not be charged tuition and other\n   fees for that course. If you have already paid for the course, you will\n   receive financial credit for course fees.\n * DISC – discontinue – The DISC date is later in the term. An academic\n   withdrawal (drop) after the DNE date, but before the DISC deadline date\n   allows you to stop attending that course with no academic penalty. Unlike the\n   DNE, however, the course will remain on your student record with an entry of\n   DISC and you will be held financially responsible for the payment of 100% of\n   tuition and other fees, including the Winter portion of a full-year course.\n * Not attending classes, or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw,\n   does not constitute an official withdrawal, nor does it entitle a student to\n   a refund of fees or cancellation of registration. Without formally dropping\n   the course by the appropriate academic withdrawal deadline, non-attendance of\n   a class will result in the assignment of a failing grade.\n * If you enroll in a fall term course that is a prerequisite for a winter\n   course and later drop the fall course, the Faculty/Department involved will\n   run a process at the beginning of the winter term to ensure that all students\n   registered in a course with prerequisites have successfully completed that\n   prerequisite.\n * Once the add/drop deadline for a term has passed, you will not have the\n   option to select that term.\n * If you have a financial hold, you will be able to drop classes, but you will\n   not be able to add classes. If you intend to replace a dropped class with a\n   new class, ensure that all financial holds are cleared.\n * For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the\n   Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the\n   Student Center page.\n\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Drop\n\nNOTE: If you receive an error message stating “You are not authorized for self\nservice enrollment at this time” when you click on the Drop tab, you will need\nto click the “change term” button and then follow the steps below.\n\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the\ntable.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1499294451/parsys-accordion/textimage_1/image.img.png/1613432244320.png]\n\n\n\nOnce the add/drop deadline for a term has passed that term will no longer be\navailable for selection from the table.\n\nClick the Continue button.\n\nAll registered classes for the term will be displayed in a grid.

The\nprocess is a combination of add and drop. The swap function allows you to verify\nthe availability of another course or section of the same course before you make\na decision. There is, therefore, no risk of losing the section you have if\nanother section is not available. \n\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, use the drop and add features to accomplish a\nsection change. If you drop the section that you are currently registered for\nand then find out that no spaces are available in other sections, you may not be\nable to get back into the section you were originally registered in as another\nstudent may have taken your place once you dropped the course.\n\nThere are some restrictions attached to swapping classes:\n\n * If you have a financial hold you will not be able to swap any classes until\n   you clear the hold.\n * Classes can only be swapped until the add/drop deadline for a given term. \n * For additional information regarding the add/drop deadlines, refer to the\n   Term Dates and Deadlines link in the Important Information section of the\n   Student Center page.\n * If you are not enrolled in any classes you will not have access to swap\n   classes.\n * The swap feature should not be used to swap between summer classes in\n   different summer sessions. For example, do not use it to swap from a May to\n   June course into a June to August course or from a full summer (May to\n   August) course into either a May to June course or a June to August course.\n\nTo swap a component of a multi-component class while keeping one or more of the\nother components (for example, swap HIST 202 Lec A, Conf AA for HIST 202 Lec A,\nConf BB while keeping the same lecture) see the section entitled Swapping\nMulti-Component Classes.\n\n\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Enroll > Swap\n\nSelect a specific term from the list of current terms that are displayed in the\ntable.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_1/image.img.png/1613432740641.png]\n\n\n\nClick the Continue button.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage/image.img.png/1613432740930.png]\n\n\n\nThe first grid on this page called, Swap This Class, displays a list of classes\nin which you are currently enrolled.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_3/image.img.png/1613432740774.png]\n\n\n\nThe next section, called With This Class, allows you to search for a class using\nthe class search feature, or to select from your Course Cart, or to enter the\nClass Nbr if you already know it.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_4/image.img.png/1613432740811.png]\n\n\n\nSelect the class that you wish to swap from with the Swap This Class grid.\n\nSelect the class that you want to swap to using the With This class grid.\n\nIf you use the search feature and identify a course, you will be asked to choose\nthe section you want by using the “select class” button and you are then\nre-directed to the Confirm your selection page.\n\nIf you Select from your Course Cart, using the select button next to that option\ntakes you to the Confirm your selection page.\n\nIf you use the Enter Class Nrb feature and press enter you will eventually reach\nthe Confirm your selection page.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_5/image.img.png/1613432741066.png]\n\n\n\nConfirm your selection and click the Finish Swapping button.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_8/image.img.png/1613432727351.png]\n\n\n\nIf the swap is unsuccessful either follow the instructions in the error message\nor try another course by selecting SWAP from the menu bar:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_10/image.img.png/1613433263319.png]\n\n\n\nView My Class Schedule to verify the status of your swap transaction:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_287826582/parsys-accordion/textimage_11/image.img.png/1613433263780.png]\n\n\n\nSWAPPING MULTI-COMPONENT CLASSES (WHILE KEEPING ONE OR MORE OF THE OTHER\nCOMPONENTS)\n\n 1. Search for the class using the search function in the With this class grid.\n    You will be prompted to make a selection for all required components even if\n    you want to keep the same sections in which you are already enrolled.\n 2. Confirm your selection. All related components of a class will be displayed.\n 3. Verify the swap transaction.\n 4. View My Class Schedule to ensure that the class has been swapped in your\n    registration.\n    \n    PLEASE NOTE – If you try to swap one of your components for another one that\n    is currently on a waitlist, then you will be placed on the waitlist for ALL\n    components of the class and potentially lose your place in the class. If you\n    do not want to take this risk, then do not use the swap feature to swap\n    components if your preferred component is on a waitlist.\n    \n    For example:\n    You are currently enrolled in COMP248 Lecture U, Tutorial U UA and\n    Laboratory UI-X. You want to stay in Lecture U and Laboratory UI-X, but swap\n    the tutorial for U UB (which is on a waitlist). If you attempt to do this\n    using a swap, you will lose your existing places in Lecture U, Tutorial U UA\n    and Laboratory UI-X and be placed on the waitlist for Lecture U, Tutorial U\n    UB and Laboratory UI-X.\n\n         D — WAIT LISTING CLASSES\n\nOnce all seats in a course have been filled it may still be possible for you to\nadd your name to a wait list. Academic departments have the choice of offering\nwait list seats or not. To determine which courses will allow you to add your\nname to a wait list:\n\n   NAVIGATION:  Academics > Search\n\n 1. Select the term\n 2. Select the subject\n 3. Select the course number\n 4. Search\n\nOnce the results of the search are displayed, click on the Section hyperlink:\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage/image.img.png/1613433263402.png]\n\n\n\nYou are now on the Class Detail page which indicates whether a Wait List is\navailable for the course selected and it is also indicated what the wait list\ncapacity is for the course and the Wait List total.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_0/image.img.png/1613433263467.png]\n\n\n\nThis tells you that 80 students can add their name to a wait list after the\nclass capacity of 770 has been reached.\n\nThere are two scenarios under which you may add your name to a wait list.\n\n 1. You have not yet enrolled in your maximum course load so that if a seat\n    becomes available you would be eligible to add it to your other courses for\n    that term.\n 2. You have enrolled in your maximum course load but you set-up your name on a\n    wait list using the swap feature so that if a seat does become available,\n    you would swap one course for another.\n    \n\nSCENARIO 1\n\nYou start the registration process by trying to register for ECON 201 but the\ncourse is full and you get the following error message:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_1/image.img.png/1613433263576.png]\n\n\n\nYou use the class search described above to see the detail of the course and\ndetermine that a wait list is available and that there is still room for you to\nadd your name. Knowing this, you select the course again and tick the box\nlabelled Wait list if class is full and select next.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_2/image.img.png/1613433263162.png]\n\n\n\nYou will see the resulting message:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1764999598/parsys-accordion/textimage_3/image.img.png/1613433263168.png]\n\n\n\nIf a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements\nyou will be registered automatically and notified via e-mail accordingly. The\nregistration in this course could take place as late as one day before the\ndeadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty.\n\nSCENARIO 2\n\nIf you are permitted to enroll in 15 credits in the fall term and you have\nalready reached that capacity but still want the possibility of entering INTE\n123, you would use the Swap This Class grid to identify which of your courses\nyou would swap. You would then go to the With This Class grid and enter the\ncourse. You will then follow the normal steps to get to the point where you\nidentify that you want to “Wait list if class is full”.\n\nIf a seat opens up in this course and you satisfy all the necessary requirements\nyou will be swapped from one course to the other automatically and notified via\ne-mail accordingly. The registration in this course could take place as late as\none day before the deadline to drop courses (DNE) without financial penalty.\n\nSOME TIPS ABOUT WAIT LISTS\n\n 1. You can wait list for a maximum of 6 units per term.\n 2. You cannot be wait listed for two sections of the same course.\n 3. You can remove your name from a wait list by using the drop feature.\n\nNote: Adding your name to a waitlist does NOT guarantee that you will get into\nthe class.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If you are on a waitlist for a course, it does not mean that you\nare actually registered for the course. You will only be registered into the\ncourse if a seat becomes available and the system registers you into the class\nbased on your waitlist position.\nSTEP 7 — VERIFY YOUR COURSES\n\nYou can verify your schedule in two different formats.\n\nFrom your Student Center page, you can choose weekly schedule.\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_332771313/parsys-accordion/textimage/image.img.png/1613433671010.png]\n\n\n\nThe resulting “My Class Schedule” page allows you to select the term for which\nyou wish to verify your registrations.

Please\nrefer to the following links:\n\n   »  Arts and Science\n[/students/registration/advising/artsandscience-advising.html]    »  John Molson\nSchool of Business\n[/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/students/advising-policies/academic-advising.html]\n   »  Engineering and Computer Science\n[/students/registration/advising/encs-advising.html]    »  Fine Arts\n[/finearts/academics/advising/new-students-advising-registration.html]\n\n\nFor non-Faculty-related problems, please call 514-848-2424, ext. 2668 Monday to\nFriday, from 09:00 – 17:00, all year round, except for holidays.\n\nShould you experience technical difficulties, please contact the Concordia\nService Desk at:\n\n * By phone: 514-848-2424, ext. 7613\n * Via email at: help@concordia.ca [help@concordia.ca]\n * By opening a ticket [/it/support/open-a-ticket.html]\n\nPlease note that the Service Desk cannot assist you directly with any issues you\nare having registering for classes. You should contact your advisor or\ndepartment or, for JMSB students, the Undergraduate Student Affairs\nOffice initially and they will then contact the Service Desk on your behalf if\nit is an issue, they are unable to resolve.\n\nSTEP 9 — OBTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE AND VERIFY PAYMENT DEADLINES\n\nInformation regarding your account balance is available from the Student Center\npage under the Finances banner:\n\n[/content/concordia/en/students/registration/_jcr_content/content-main/tabs/parsys-tabs-0/accordion_panel_1616393938/parsys-accordion/textimage/image.img.png/1613433922755.png]\n\n\n\nPAYMENT DEADLINES:\n\n * Due Now – this is the amount that you owe for the tuition and fees for the\n   current term. An amount may show as ‘Due now’ before the final payment\n   deadline. For example, the tuition fees for a Fall term are generally due at\n   the beginning of September but you are allowed until the end of September to\n   pay them without financial penalty. These fees will show as ‘Due Now’ in your\n   Student Centre from the beginning of September.\n   \n   \n * Future Due – this is the amount that you will have to pay for the upcoming\n   term(s), including tuition and fees for classes you have enrolled in for any\n   upcoming term(s). For example, if you are enrolling in Winter classes before\n   the beginning of January, the tuition fees for these classes will show as\n   ‘Future Due’ in your Student Centre until the beginning of January.\n    \n\nPLEASE NOTE – if you have recently enrolled or dropped some classes and you\nwould like to see your updated tuition balance, you can click on the “Account\nInquiry” link in the top-left of the Finances section.  This will trigger a\nrecalculation of your tuition fees and update your balance accordingly.\n\nFor more information about tuition fees and payment deadlines, please visit the\nTuition and Fees [/students/financial/tuition-fees.html]page.\n\n* $90 Late registration fee\nUndergraduate Students who register between the first day of class and the last\nday to register will be charged a Late Registration fee. Please note that\nundergraduate students making course or section changes are not charged any\nadditional fees as long as their initial registration occurred before the start\nof the fall or winter term.

As part of its commitment to promoting\nequal access to education and an inclusive campus community, the university is\nincreasing the number of inclusive and accessible washrooms on campus. The goal\nis to reduce disability and gender-based barriers encountered by community\nmembers.\n\nAt this time, the university's focus is on installing inclusive and accessible\nfacilities in buildings that are frequented by the largest number of students,\nfaculty and staff on both its campuses. Criteria such as the condition of\ninfrastructure and other renovation projects are also considered during the\nprioritization process.\n\nAs a university committed to inclusion, Concordia will continue to ensure that\nthere a variety of facilities available to the community, including individual\nwashrooms. This approach takes into account the diversity of Concordia’s campus\ncommunity and builds in options and solutions that meet a variety of needs.\n\nLearn more about Concordia's Policy on Accessibility and Accommodation for\nStudents and Employees\n[/about/policies/spotlight/policy-on-accessibility-and-accommodation-for-students-and-employees-prvpa-14.html]\n\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nConcordia is first and foremost a group of diverse people. Their views are\ncritical in understanding needs and aspirations. To honour this commitment to\ndiversity, the university has taken a consultative approach to the development\nand deployment of inclusive and accessible washrooms across its campuses.\n\nThe aim of this strategy is to support an inclusive university culture that\nvalues the experiences of underrepresented groups and people with diverse access\nneeds. Facilities Management [/offices/facilities.html] continues to work\nclosely with various internal partners, while the Equity Office\n[/equity.html] plays a key role throughout the planning and development phases.\n\nTogether, the team analyzes, iterates and continuously consults the broader\ncommunity to ensure ample opportunity for course corrections.\n\n\n\n\nDESIGN\n\nNew inclusive and accessible washrooms are designed with practicality and\nefficiency in mind. For instance, grooming areas are separate from the central\nhand-washing zones to prevent congestion.\n\nInclusive facilities also deliver a host of helpful amenities. Examples include:\n\n * Floor-to-ceiling stalls for privacy and security\n * Doorless, open entryways that encourage an efficient flow through the space\n * Central washroom areas that connect to main hallways to ensure safe and\n   effective circulation\n * An adjustable step under the sink area\n * Water fountains and water-bottle fillers\n * Colour-coded locks to indicate when a stall is in use\n * A free tampon dispenser\n * Touch-free faucets and hand dryers above the sinks in certain washrooms\n\nIn addition, carefully considered design elements like customized lighting\nzones, a bright colour palette and a skylight effect above the washing area\ncreate a welcoming environment.\n\nOn top of meeting equity goals, particular attention has been paid to building\nenjoyable spaces that people feel comfortable using.\n\n\nTIMELINE\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n2018\n\n * Completed an analysis to convert washrooms on the main levels of the\n   Engineering, Computer Science and Visual Arts Integrated Complex (EV)\n   [/maps/sgw-campus.html?building=EV], J.W.

This decision included a commitment to make individuals washrooms\n   available on floors with inclusive and accessible washrooms.\n * Launched the Hall 6 transformation\n   [/cunews/main/stories/2021/08/17/concordias-redesigned-hall-6-is-a-model-for-future-campus-projects.html]\n   as a pilot project for installing the building's first inclusive and\n   accessible washrooms.\n * Submitted an application to the Régie du bâtiment du Québec to modify\n   sanitary installations in the Hall Building.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n2020\n\n * Administered surveys and consultations with Concordia students, faculty and\n   staff in partnership with SOM, a research firm specializing in data\n   collection, data analysis and data visualization.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n2021\n\n * Continued to administer surveys and consultations in partnership with SOM.\n * Directed accessibility audits of the Sir George Williams and Loyola campuses\n   and led a circulation study of both campuses.\n * Completed the inclusive and accessible washrooms project\n   [/cunews/main/stories/2020/07/14/new-classrooms-and-study-locations-coming-to-concordias-faubourg-building.html] in\n   the basement of the Faubourg (FB) Building\n   [/maps/sgw-campus.html?building=FB].\n * In collaboration with HCMA, an architecture and design firm, began work on a\n   five-year accessibility and inclusivity plan that will outline steps for\n   Concordia to take to make progress toward its vision for accessible and\n   inclusive facilities. The plan will be informed by expert recommendations,\n   surveys and feedback on inclusive and accessible washrooms.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n2022\n\n * Confirmed that all newly renovated public washrooms will be inclusive and\n   accessible, everywhere possible. This decision was made by Concordia's senior\n   management, in collaboration with the Equity Office, following consultations\n   and surveys by SOM.\n * Established that all floors of the Hall Building will include inclusive and\n   accessible washrooms — not just those on alternating floors.\n * Based on the continued work of the five-year accessibility action\n   plan, resolved that physical adaptation — not just signage — is paramount to\n   the successful transformation of inclusive and accessible washrooms.\n * Oversaw an online survey, a vision workshop and a series of consultation\n   workshops focused on key aspects of the physical environment on campus.\n * Delivered the Hall Building’s second inclusive and accessible washroom on the\n   fourth floor as part of the Hall 4 renovation project.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n2023\n\n * Opened the first inclusive and accessible washrooms at the Loyola Campus on\n   the fifth floor of the Administration (AD) Building\n   [/maps/loyola-campus.html?building=AD].\n * Renovated washrooms on the [/maps/loyola-campus.html?building=AD] first floor\n   of the Communications and Journalism (CJ) Building\n   [/maps/loyola-campus.html?building=CJ] that go beyond code requirements for\n   accessible washrooms.

Preference for\n   single-stall gender inclusive washrooms.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFUTURE OF WASHROOMS ON CAMPUS\n\nCONCERNS AROUND:\n\n * Design solutions being better suited for newer and/or larger buildings,\n   rather than some of the small, inaccessible buildings on campus and the\n   extent of other barriers that exist.\n * Design solutions requiring a large amount of square footage that would need\n   to be taken from other existing spaces.\n * Options for updating when the visibility and openness of existing washroom\n   spaces is poor.\n * Options for updating washrooms in spaces or buildings that are rented and not\n   owned by Concordia.\n * The security of washroom spaces, especially after hours, and a need to go\n   above and beyond just installing cameras.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVISIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF WASHROOMS ON CAMPUS\n\nSUPPORT FOR:\n\n * Creating welcoming and respectful spaces.\n * Creating private, safe, clean spaces where users can feel relaxed, secure and\n   not isolated.\n * Incorporating multiple accessible stalls within a multi-stall washroom.\n * Accessible and inclusive washroom signage.\n * Signage and interactive maps that identify gender inclusive washroom\n   locations.\n * The integration of quiet, touch-free fixtures.\n * The integration of adequate lighting (well-lit spaces) and proper\n   ventilation.\n * Integrating inclusive décor, including colours, graphics and images and\n   removal of cis- and hetero-normative ads and images.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n\n * For more information on inclusivity resources and support for students, visit\n   the Centre for Gender Advocacy [https://genderadvocacy.org/].\n * For student accommodations and support, visit the Access Centre for Students\n   with Disabilities (ACSD)\n   [https://www.concordia.ca/students/accessibility.html]. \n * For support on equity issues, visit the Equity Office\n   [https://www.concordia.ca/equity.html].","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/maps/buildings/inclusive-washrooms.html","title":"Inclusive washrooms on campus - Concordia University","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"RECREATION, SPORTS & FITNESS\n\nActivate Your Way\n\n\n\n\nACTIVATE THIS SPRING/SUMMER\n\nSign up for an energizing workout\n\nLearn more [/campus-life/recreation/fitness/schedule.html]\n\n\nJOIN LE GYM\n\nKeep moving and reach your fitness goals\n\nLearn more [/campus-life/recreation/facilities/le-gym.html]\n\n\nWORK WITH AN EXPERT\n\nPersonal training at Le Gym\n\nLearn more [/campus-life/recreation/fitness/personal-training.html]\n\n\nONLINE FITNESS CLASSES\n\nRegistration starts April 23\n\nLearn more\n[/campus-life/recreation/fitness/online-fitness-classes/spring-schedule.html]\nPrevious Next PAUSE\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntramural Leagues [/campus-life/recreation/intramurals.html]\nIn-person activities & classes [/campus-life/recreation/fitness/schedule.html]\nOnline fitness classes\n[/campus-life/recreation/fitness/online-fitness-classes.html]\nNutrition [/campus-life/recreation/fitness/nutrition.html]\nPersonal training [/campus-life/recreation/fitness/personal-training.html]\nAt home workouts [/campus-life/recreation/fitness/at-home-workouts.html]\nWork with us [/campus-life/recreation/jobs.html]\nFitness centre - Le Gym [/campus-life/recreation/facilities/le-gym.html]\nFacilities & rentals [/campus-life/recreation/facilities.html]\nContact us [/campus-life/recreation/contact.html]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFITNESS CENTRE - LE GYM [/campus-life/recreation/facilities/le-gym.html]\n\nA comprehensive fitness facility located on the downtown campus.

I started my trip at the Center\nfor the Evolutionary Origins of Human Behavior, which is a Kyoto University\ncampus located in Inuyama. I was able to collect behavioural data for my\nresearch project on a captive group of Japanese macaques housed at this\ninstitute. There were 20 macaques from this group that I included in my study. I\ncollected around 93 hours of usable data.\n\nFor the second part of my trip, I was on the island of Awajishima in Japan. I\ncollected behavioural data for my research project on a semi-wild group of\nJapanese macaques. They live in the forest but are also free to come to the\nmonkey center as they please. There were 22 macaques from this group in my\nstudy, and I collected about 128 hours of usable data.\n\nSince coming back to Canada, the only thing that I have on my mind is how I can\nreturn to Japan! This experience has taught me so much, and I do not think there\nis any replacement for hands-on learning like this trip.\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVER BROGAN'S RESEARCH WITH JAPANESE MACQUES\n\nBrogan Stewart, Concordia International Scholar shares her experience in Japan\ncollecting behavioural data of the Japanese macaques.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nGOING ABROAD & RISK AWARENESS\n\nHealth and Safety Abroad\n[/students/exchanges/winter-2021-outbound-exchange-students/winter-outbound-covid.html]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUSEFUL RESOURCES\n\n\nPLAN YOUR BUDGET\n\ndownload our budget tool\n[/content/dam/concordia/offices/ci/docs/CSEP_2021_budget_form.pdf]","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/students/exchanges/research_abroad.html","title":"Research Abroad - Concordia University","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"VISITING RESEARCHERS\n\n[/content/concordia/en/offices/ci/visiting-researchers/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container/grid-container-parsys/card_deck/card-deck-parsys/card/adaptiveimage.img.620.medium.jpg/1607619078253.jpg]\n\n\nHOW TO COME TO CONCORDIA\n\n[/international/academic-visitors.html]\n[/content/concordia/en/offices/ci/visiting-researchers/_jcr_content/content-main/grid_container/grid-container-parsys/card_deck/card-deck-parsys/card_1785660144/adaptiveimage.img.620.medium.jpg/1607619095351.jpg]\nFor Concordia Faculty\n\n\nHOW TO INVITE A RESEARCHER\n\n[/offices/ci/inviting-academic-visitors.html]\nEXPLORE CONCORDIA [http://explore.concordia.ca/]","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/offices/ci/visiting-researchers.html","title":"Visiting researchers - Concordia University","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"RESEARCH AT CONCORDIA\n\nOur researchers are making a difference for communities across Canada and\nglobally.\n\nOur community embraces social responsibility, fostering equitable and\nsustainable research practices to tackle global challenges.

For the Master's study program, the maximum\n   number of sessions is 5 and for the Doctoral study program, the maximum\n   number is 15.\n\nPlease note that there are exceptional circumstances\n[https://www.quebec.ca/en/education/student-financial-assistance/quebec-perspective-scholarship/eligibility-requirements]\nwherein a student could be eligible despite not completing the full required\nnumber of credits in a term.\n\nINELIGIBILITY AND EXCLUSIONS\n\n * Students receiving the Quebec Excellence Scholarships for Students in\n   Education Programs are not eligible to apply for Quebec Perspective Bursary\n   funding.\n * Students in Concordia’s education programs are no longer eligible for the\n   Intern Perseverance and Success Scholarship, because they are now supported\n   by the Quebec Perspective Bursary. \n * Co-op programs are eligible for funding by this program, however, terms\n   during which students are participating in paid internships are NOT\n   eligible. \n * Credits earned from courses done in addition to your program are NOT\n   eligible.

Students should verify that their degree\nprogram is eligible.\n\nPlease note independent studies, diplomas, and certificates are not eligible for\nU.S. Direct Loan funding.\n\nREGISTRATION AND COURSE LOAD\n\nTo be eligible for U.S. Direct Loans, you must be registered in a minimum of 6\ncredits per semester. Waitlisted courses do not count toward your total credits.\n\nInternational students are expected to maintain a full-time course load (12 to\n15 credits per semester) as a condition of immigration requirements. If you plan\non studying less than full time, you should contact the International Students\nOffice (ISO) [https://www.concordia.ca/students/international.html] to ensure\nyou do not have any difficulties with Immigration Quebec or the Department of\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nDISTANCE EDUCATION / ONLINE COURSES\n\nAs a Title IV Foreign Institution, our office must abide by the laws of Title IV\nAid as mandated by the U.S. Federal Government. For recipients of Direct Loan\nfunding, this means that the version of the program in which you are accepted\ncannot include the following:\n\nAny use of a telecommunications course, correspondence course or direct\nassessment (CFR 600.51 (d)).\n\nAny student that takes any online course(s) is ineligible to receive Direct Loan\nfunding for the duration of their program.\n\nAs such, students receiving Title IV Aid must register for on-campus courses\nonly throughout their academic career at Concordia. Should you register in any\nineligible course as outlined above, you are automatically considered to be in\nan ineligible program and will immediately become ineligible for Title IV Aid.\nThere is no appeal for this requirement.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss your study plans with a Financial Aid Advisor\nbefore registering.\n\nCONCORDIA UNIVERSITY TITLE IV AID – SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS POLICY\n\nU.S. Federal regulations require that the University evaluate the academic\nprogress of all Title IV student loan recipients from the first date of\nenrolment at Concordia University, whether or not loans were received at that\ntime. Credits transferred from all other institutions will be considered as\nattempted and completed credits in the evaluation of the completion rate\nstandards, but these courses do not affect the calculation of your GPA.\n\nCONCORDIA UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS\n\nTo be eligible for Title IV Aid, you must meet Concordia University's\ninstitutional requirements for minimum satisfactory performance. These are\ndefined in the Undergraduate Calendar (Section 16.3) and the Graduate Calendar\n(Section – Academic Regulations) and will also be reiterated under each\nFaculty's section. Note that you must maintain a minimum annual GPA of 2.0 in\nall Undergraduate Faculties and 3.0 for Graduate Faculties. \n\nDISC, INC, MED, DEF, AU, F/FNS/R/NR & S Grades, and repeated course work will be\ntreated as follows:\n\n * Course withdrawals (DISC) after the drop/add period are not included in the\n   GPA calculation but are considered as non-completion of attempted course\n   work.\n * Incomplete (INC) indicates that you have not completed required course work,\n   and that the instructor has agreed to accept the work after the due date. The\n   notation is always used in combination with a letter grade such as B/INC and\n   the grade is used in the calculation of the various GPAs.\n * Medical (MED) indicates that you have been unable to write a final\n   examination or complete other assignments due to a long-term medical\n   situation. A MED notation carries no grade point value.\n * Deferred (DEF) indicates that you have been unable to write a final\n   examination. A DEF notation carries no grade point value.\n * An audit (AU) grade is not considered attempted course work. It is not\n   included in the GPA calculation or completion rate determinations.\n * F/FNS/R/NR grades are treated as attempted credits that were not earned and\n   so are included in both the calculation of GPA and minimum completion rate.\n * A satisfactory grade (S) is treated as attempted credits that are earned but\n   is not included in calculation of GPA.\n\nIn case of repeated courses, only the grade corresponding to the latest attempt\nof the course will be used in calculation of the various GPAs, but every\nrepeated attempt will be included in the completion rate determinations. No\nloans can be disbursed for a repeated attempt if you have already achieved a\npassing grade for that course. The University's policy means that you receive\naid for only one repeat of a course. \n\nSATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR TITLE IV AID RECIPIENTS\n\nThe following policy applies to Title IV Aid recipients who are full-time,\nquarter-time or part-time in undergraduate or graduate level studies in Title IV\nAid-eligible programs. As a Title IV Aid recipient, you are required to be in\ngood standing, maintain satisfactory academic progress toward your degree\nrequirements for each semester in which you are enrolled, and complete your\ndegree in the prescribed period according to your program. Satisfactory Academic\nProgress (SAP), as described below, is evaluated on an annual basis in June.\nNote, that SAP for Title IV aid recipients is stricter than the University’s\nregulations as pace of progression, maximum timeframe completion in addition to\nacademic performance are measured. Failure to maintain satisfactory academic\nprogress may result in the loss of your Title IV Aid eligibility.\n\nSATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo achieve SAP per the U.S. Federal Student Aid regulations, students must:\n\n * Maintain a minimum annual GPA of 2.0. (undergraduates) and 3.0 (graduate\n   students) AND\n * Maintain a minimum cumulative completion rate of two-thirds of credits\n   attempted (67%).\n\nFurthermore, for students enrolled in an educational program of more than two\nacademic years, must have a minimum Cumulative GPA of 2.0 or have the academic\nstanding consistent within their faculty’s published requirements for\ngraduation.\n\nMAXIMUM TIMEFRAME\n\nThe FAAO will ensure that students are completing their educational program\nwithin a timeframe no longer than 150% of its published length. For example, a\nstudent must complete their program after attempting a maximum of 180 credits\nfor a 120-credit program.\n\nAll attempted credits will be counted towards the student's maximum timeframe.\nThe student fails to meet the maximum timeframe component at the point in which\nit is determined that it is not mathematically possible for the student to\ncomplete within the maximum timeframe, not at the point they reach the maximum\ntimeframe.\n\nThe following administrative notations count towards a student’s attempted\ncredits and maximum timeframe: CODE, DEF, DISC, DNW, EXCL, EXTR, INC, INIT, MED,\nPEND, PTR, RPT, SRCR, SREP, SUPP, TRC, VALD, WRKT.\n\nPer Title IV regulations, courses in which a students remained enrolled past the\nadd/drop deadline cannot be excluded from a student’s SAP evaluation. Therefore,\ncourses in which a late withdrawal (DNE or DISC) was granted, with or without\ntuition refund, will be counted towards the maximum timeframe as attempted\ncredits.\n\nPACE OF PROGRESSION\n\nExample of ideal pace of progression (attempted and completed) for an\nundergraduate student:\n\n0-30 credits = year 1\n\n30-60 credits = year 2 (with a minimum Cumulative GPA of 2.0 or more)\n\n60-90 credits = year 3\n\n90-120 credits = year 4\n\nFor the purposes of calculating a student pace of progression, the FAAO will\ndivide the total number of credits successfully completed by the number credits\nattempted.\n\nExample: A student passed 15 credits of an attempted 24 credits.\n\n15/24 = 62.5% - this indicates the student did not make academic progress.\n\nFor graduate students, the maximum timeframe will be defined by the School of\nGraduate Studies upon admission and will be monitored and evaluated on an annual\nbasis.\n\nSTUDENT LOAN DENIED STATUS\n\nIf you fail to meet the minimum 2.0 (or 3.0) annual or cumulative GPA standard\nor fail to complete at least two-thirds of cumulative credits attempted, you\nwill immediately lose your eligibility for Title IV Aid and be placed on Student\nLoan Denied status. No Title IV Aid will be disbursed unless you have submitted\nan appeal, and the appeal has been granted. There are no exceptions to this\nregulation.\n\nIf you fail to satisfy the 150% maximum timeframe requirement, you will also be\nplaced on Student Loan Denied status. No Title IV Aid will be disbursed unless\nyou have made an appeal, and the appeal is granted. There are no exceptions to\nthis regulation. If you are in a 120-credit bachelor’s degree program and have\nattempted in excess of 180 credits, including transfer credits, you are no\nlonger eligible for Title IV Aid.\n\nAll Title IV Aid recipients who fail the any of the above SAP standards will be\nnotified by email within one (1) week of the determination to advise they have\nbeen placed on Student Loan Denied status and given a specific date to submit\ntheir appeal (if applicable).\n\nREINSTATEMENT OF AID AFTER STUDENT LOAN DENIED STATUS\n\nReinstatement of financial aid after you have been placed on Student Loan Denied\nstatus may be achieved in one of the following ways:\n\n * You attend Concordia University for one academic year and register for a\n   minimum of 12 credits and do well enough in your course work to meet all the\n   SAP standards. You can regain aid eligibility on probationary status.\n * You submit a written appeal in accordance with the appeal process. If the\n   FAAO grants the appeal, you will then be placed on Student Loan Probation for\n   ONE payment period. You must attain a minimum 2.0 term GPA in that payment\n   period to qualify for the second disbursement. Your next academic evaluation\n   will use the term GPA of the 1st payment period of the aid year. This\n   evaluation will normally be done in September, January or June, after which\n   time if your GPA is not above the 2.0 minimum or pace of progression has not\n   been attained, you will immediately be placed on US Student Loan Denied\n   status and become ineligible for any further Title IV Aid until all of the\n   above noted SAP requirements have been met.\n\nAPPEAL PROCESS\n\nYou may appeal your Student Loan Denied status if it can be determined that an\nunusual or extraordinary situation affected your academic progress. An example\nof an unusual or extraordinary situation would be a death in the family or a\nserious illness.\n\nAppeals must:\n\n * Be submitted in writing to the FAAO's Director and/or your Financial Aid\n   Advisor by the date specified in the Student Loan Denied notification\n   letter. \n * Contain documentation that supports your unusual or extraordinary situation\n   (i.e., death of a family member is supported by a death certificate). In\n   addition, your statement must include a specific plan for your academic\n   recovery.\n * Explain what has changed in your situation that will allow you to meet the\n   SAP requirements at the next evaluation. \n\nShould you require additional information regarding this process, please visit\nthe FAAO.\n\nSTUDY ABROAD\n\nStudents participating in a Study Abroad program and paying tuition and fees at\nanother institution are not eligible to receive U.S.\nsubsidized/unsubsidized/PLUS or alternative loans through Concordia. You must\nmake arrangements with the institution you have chosen to attend for your\nfinancial aid. \n\nEXCHANGE PROGRAMS\n\nU.S. students studying on official Concordia exchange through Concordia\nInternational are considered Concordia students for the purposes of U.S.\nsubsidized/unsubsidized/PLUS, and alternative loans.

For example, if you are\nenrolled in the Fall and Winter semesters, you will receive two disbursements:\none per semester.\n\nYou will receive an email from the FAAO confirming that your funds have arrived\nat Concordia University.\n\nOnce your tuition and fees have been deducted from your loan and if there is a\ncredit remaining on your student account, you will be issued a refund cheque.\nThe cheque will be issued in Canadian funds.\n\nThe FAAO will notify you when and where it will be available to be picked up.\n\nPlease note that the U.S. exchange rate used is the one in effect the day the\nloan is posted to your student account.\n\nBANKING\n\nIt is recommended that you open a Canadian bank account so you can deposit\nUniversity-issued cheques, pay bills, and access your funds. Many banks will\nallow you to apply for a bank account online, so you can start the process\nbefore you get to Montreal. Here are the websites of several banks with branches\nnear Concordia:\n\n * BMO [https://www.bmo.com/en-ca/main/personal/]\n * CIBC [https://www.cibc.com/en/personal-banking/bank-accounts.html] \n * Desjardins [https://www.cibc.com/en/personal-banking/bank-accounts.html]\n * Laurentian Bank [https://www.laurentianbank.ca/en]\n * Royal Bank of Canada [https://www.rbc.com/canada.html]\n * Scotiabank [https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal.html]\n * TD  [https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking]\n\nBORROWER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nREPAY YOUR LOAN\n\nYour obligation to repay becomes legally binding when you sign the Master\nPromissory Note (MPN) and authorize the electronic transfer of funds to your\nstudent account. Your requirement to repay does not go away because you haven’t\ncompleted your educational program, cannot find employment, were not satisfied\nwith the education or other services your received from the University, or were\nnotified that your loan was sold to another party by your lender.\n\nMINIMUM PAYMENT\n\nA minimum monthly loan payment is required. This minimum amount varies depending\non the amount you borrowed and your repayment plan.\n\nPAY ON TIME\n\nYou must make your payments on time unless you have made special arrangements\nwith the lender or servicer. Many lenders offer repayment incentives to reward\nyou for paying on time.\n\nWITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY\n\nIf you withdraw from the University, you may be required to repay part of or all\nyour loan(s).\n\nYou may also owe the University any loan funds returned on your behalf. The U.S.\nDepartment of Education regulations state that a school must return loan funds\nif a student has not completed a minimum of 60% of the payment/enrolment period.\nIf you received more loan funding than was \"earned,\" the excess funds must be\nreturned by the school and/or the student. The amount of money to be returned is\ndetermined by a specific formula that is used in a calculation called a \"Return\nto Title IV.\" If you did not receive all the funds that were earned, you may be\neligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement. Further information is available\nhere:\n\nDownload the Return of Title IV (R2T4) Policy (PDF)\n[/content/dam/concordia/offices/faao/docs/USStudentAid/R2T4PoliciesProcedures05192022.pdf]\n\nNOTIFY THE LENDER/LOAN SERVICER\n\nYou must notify your Lender/Loan Servicer of any changes to your situation. This\nincludes your name, address, contact information, driver's license number or\nSocial Security Number. You must also inform them if you withdraw from the\nUniversity or drop below half-time status. You can find your Lender/Loan\nServicer by logging in to the FSA website and visiting your My Aid page\n[https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/servicers].\n\nTo find out who your loan servicer is: \n\n * Visit your account dashboard [https://studentaid.gov/] and scroll down to the\n   “My Loan Servicers” section, or\n * Call the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243.\n\nTITLE IV AID: AMERICAN OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT\n\nAs an eligible educational institution, Concordia University can only provide\nCanadian federal (T2202A) and Quebec provincial (RL-8) tax receipts. If you are\nfiling taxes in the U.S., you can use the information on the T2202A, along with\nConcordia’s EIN (Employer Identification Number) 98-1422233. You will require\nthis information to complete your U.S. income tax returns.\n\nU.S. LOAN TERMINOLOGY\n\nAward year: The 12-month period during which you attend the University, and for\nwhich your aid has been awarded.\n\nCapitalization: The process by which interest is added to the principal loan\namount if you choose not to make interest payments while at the University or\nare in forbearance. This process increases the amount that must be repaid and\nwill make your monthly payment larger.\n\nCost of Attendance (COA): The total amount it will cost you to go to school.\nThis amount includes tuition fees, living expenses, books, insurance, travel and\ntransportation. The COA is determined by the FAAO, using U.S. guidelines.\n\nDefault: The failure of a borrower to repay the loan under the terms of the\npromissory note. If your repayment instalments are monthly, you are considered\nin default if you do not pay for 270 consecutive days. If your instalments are\nless frequent, default is declared after 330 consecutive days of non-payment.\n\nDeferment: The temporary postponement of loan payments. If you’re enrolled in an\neligible college or career school at least half-time, in most cases your loan\nwill be placed into a deferment automatically. If you enroll at least half-time\nbut do not automatically receive a deferment, you should contact the FAAO.\n\nDelinquency: The status of a loan when payment is late. Delinquency can lead to\ndefault.\n\nDisbursement: The lender's payment of loan funds to the University. Disbursement\nis usually made in two or more instalments during the year in accordance with\nU.S. Department of Education regulations.\n\nForbearance: The temporary postponement or reduction of payments because of the\nborrower's financial difficulties. Forbearance may also be an extension of the\nrepayment period. You are charged interest during forbearance.\n\nFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)\n[https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa]: The application that you must\nfile to apply for financial aid. The FAFSA is printed and distributed free of\ncharge by the U.S. Department of Education. It is available online.\n\nFull-time: Enrolment in 12 or more credits per semester.\n\nGrace period: A period of time between when you graduate or drop below half-time\nstatus and when repayment begins. For Direct Loans, the grace period is\nsix-months. There is no grace period for PLUS Loans. If you re-enter school at\nleast half-time during your grace period, the grace period is renewed for\nanother six months. Therefore, you have the full grace period available when you\nleave school again. However, if you use all your grace period at once and\nre-enter school, you will not be eligible for another grace period.\n\nHalf-time: Enrolment in 6 to 8.75 credits per semester.\n\nInterest: The fee that is charged by the lender in exchange for lending the\nmoney, the interest rate, usually expressed as a percentage of the loan amount,\nmay stay the same for the term of the loan (fixed rate) or it may change\nperiodically (variable rate). Interest rates for Direct Loans are fixed, whereas\nthose of alternative loans may vary.\n\nMaster Promissory Note (MPN): A legally binding contract that you sign, thereby\nagreeing to repay the loan. It contains the loan terms and conditions, including\nhow and when the loan must be repaid.\n\nPrincipal: When you borrow money for a loan, the principal is the total amount\nthat was lent before any interest or fees are added. Outstanding principal\nrefers to the remaining amount of the original loan, plus any capitalized\ninterest.\n\nStudent Aid Index (SAI): The amount that you and family are expected to\ncontribute toward the Cost of Attendance. This amount is based on your or your\nfamily's income and assets.\n\nSubsidized Loan: A loan made based on financial need. The federal government\npays the interest on these loans while you are enrolled at least half-time,\nduring the grace period, or during authorized periods of deferment.\n\nThree-Quarter time: Enrolment in 9 to 11.75 credits per semester.\n\nUnsubsidized Loan: A loan not based on financial need. You are responsible for\npaying all interest that accrues throughout the life of an unsubsidized loan.\nDuring in-school status, deferment, and forbearance periods, you may choose to\npay the interest charged on the loan or allow the interest to be capitalized.\n\nWithdrawn: A student is considered to have withdrawn from a payment period or\nperiod of enrollment if, in the case of a program that is measured in credit\nhours, the student does not complete all the days in the payment period or\nperiod of enrollment that the student was scheduled to complete.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\nAs a U.S. Loan recipient, you will be assigned a Financial Aid Advisor to help\nyou find ways to plan your finances and navigate the funding opportunities\navailable to help you pay for your education.\n\nIf you are unsure who to contact at our office, please email us\nat fundingyoureducation@concordia.ca [ fundingyoureducation@concordia.ca]\n\nLocation\nSGW Campus Financial Aid and Awards Office 1550 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W. GM\n230.00 (see map) [https://www.concordia.ca/maps/sgw-campus.html?building=GM]\n\nMailing address\nFinancial Aid and Awards Office 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W.

The hands-on experience offered in her Computer\nScience program [/academics/degrees/bachelor-of-computer-science.html], coupled\nwith theory, helped her apply what she learned in the classroom to her everyday\nwork.\n\nNow in Orange County, California, where she works as a software developer for\nSignature Estate & Investment Advisors, LLC [https://www.seia.com/], Zamani\nrecalls how she found her path at Concordia.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWHAT WAS THE BEST PART ABOUT YOUR CONCORDIA EXPERIENCE?\n\nEverything! I made so many friends there and I use what I learned at Concordia\nin my job today. I referenced many of the courses I took in my job interview. I\ncouldn’t have done it without my bachelor’s degree. My experience at Concordia\nreally helped me.\n\n\nWHAT DID YOU SPECIFICALLY ENJOY ABOUT THE PROGRAM?\n\nI liked the hands-on experience and learning programming in the computer lab. It\nwasn’t only sitting in the classroom and learning it in theory. We had the means\nto try it ourselves and understand what we were taught in the classroom. \n\n\nHOW DID YOUR DEGREE PLAY A ROLE IN SHAPING YOUR PROFESSIONAL CHOICES?\n\nConcordia was the very first step in my professional career. A bachelor’s degree\ngives you the opportunity to familiarize yourself with what kind of computer\nscientist or software developer you want to be in the future.\n\nI had a web-programming course, for example, that I really enjoyed, so I thought\nwhy not look for a job where I get to do that every day? The professors, the\nprojects we were given and the options we were offered really helped us find our\npath after graduation.\n\n\nTELL US ABOUT YOUR CURRENT ROLE.\n\nAfter Concordia I moved to Toronto, pursued my master’s at Ryerson University\nand worked for a year and half. My husband and I moved to California in 2020\nafter he found a job here. The option to move was always in the cards — we both\nhave dual citizenship and wanted warmer weather.\n\nI really enjoy my current job, with a financial advising company, where I’ve\nbeen for almost a year. Our team is in charge of our in-house system, our\nwebsite and our own software for advisors. I’ve learned a lot about trading and\nstock markets.\n\n\nWHAT IS YOUR ADVICE FOR CURRENT STUDENTS?\n\nContinue your studies. I believe it’s 100 per cent worth it in the end. It helps\ngive you confidence in job interviews and in the workplace.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.concordia.ca/content/shared/en/profiles/students/undergraduate/ghazal-zamani.html?c=/admissions/undergraduate","title":"Ghazal Zamani - Concordia University","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"STUDENT STORIES\n\nShow:\nAll\nStudents\nAlumni\n\nSearch\nJade Adams\n\n\nJADE ADAMS\n\nalumnus_alumna\nBachelor of Arts\nMajor Creative Writing, Minor Professional Writing\n[/content/shared/en/profiles/students/undergraduate/jade-adams.html]\nAlumnus/Alumna Faculty of Arts & Science [/artsci.html]\nD.J.

We respect the\ncontinued connections with the past, present and future in our ongoing\nrelationships with Indigenous and other peoples within the Montreal community.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPRONUNCIATION\n\nYour browser does not support HTML audio but you can still download the file\n[https://pegasus.concordia.ca/Flv_Content/audio/Territorial_Acknowledegment_Pronunciation_Guide.mp3].\n\nWahéhshon Shiann Whitebean has prepared a comprehensive resource that provides\nthorough explanations of the history of the Territorial Acknowledgement, the\nrationale behind the specific wording, and responses to a number of frequently\nasked questions about the Acknowledgement. \n\n * History \n * Rationale \n * Convocation \n * FAQ \n * Videos \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHISTORY\n\nThroughout our history, Concordia has sustained relationships with Indigenous\npeoples and communities on the Island of Tiohtià:ke or Montréal and its\nsurrounding area. The Concordia Indigenous Directions Leadership Group is\ncurrently developing a history section on the Indigenous Directions Hub to\ndepict and celebrate many of the occasions and collaborations that we have\nshared. The following is a brief history and explanation of the Territorial\nAcknowledgment upon which we hope to build.\n\nThe Concordia community has developed many versions of Territorial\nAcknowledgements, practices, and gestures that continue to foster meaningful and\nrespectful relationships with Indigenous community members, knowledge keepers,\nand collaborative partners. The Territorial Acknowledgement that we are\npracticing today is grounded in that history. Many members of Concordia’s staff,\nfaculty, students, and community partners have made a contribution to the\ndiscussion, wording, and rationale behind it. Our Acknowledgement is built from\ncumulative efforts of many minds from diverse backgrounds and we hope to keep an\non-going dialogue with all of our stakeholders.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nRATIONALE\n\n\nHOW AND WHY WE WORDED THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THIS WAY, LINE BY LINE\n\nThis specific version of the Territorial Acknowledgement was primarily authored\nby Wahéhshon Shiann Whitebean and Dr. Karl S. Hele, with significant\ncontributions at the final stages from Dr. Louellyn White. The final draft was\nagreed upon unanimously and passed by the Indigenous Directions Leadership Group\non February 16, 2017.\n\n1. “I/WE WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY IS\nLOCATED ON UNCEDED INDIGENOUS LANDS.”\n\nWe debated and discussed variations of this statement that included naming a\nnumber of First Nations and Indigenous communities that are rooted in the Island\nof Montréal and surrounding area. Many First Peoples claim the land and\nwaterways as a homeland, traditional territory or birthplace of their people\nsince time immemorial. This includes, but may not be limited to, the\nKanien’kehá:ka (Mohawk) of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, Huron/Wendat, Abenaki,\nand Anishinaabeg (Algonquin). It is not our role to offer a determination of\nclaim, instead we offer recognition and support of all Indigenous peoples and\nNations who have and continue to make these lands and waters their homes. We\nkept the word “unceded” since there are no agreements or treaties that have\ntransferred title from any Indigenous Nation to Settler ownership or control;\nthe land was occupied without permission. This also demonstrates that we\nrecognize the injustices that are part of the colonial history of this place and\nthat Concordia boldly supports and stands in solidarity with the Indigenous\nmembers of our community.\n\n2. THE KANIEN’KEHÁ:KA NATION ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE CUSTODIANS OF THE LANDS AND\nWATERS ON WHICH WE GATHER TODAY.\n\nMany Indigenous peoples, communities, and Nations helped to build the foundation\nof Tiohtià:ke. However, it is understood and widely supported that the\nKanien’kehá:ka have a strong historic and ongoing presence in the territory with\ntwo communities bordering Montréal: Kahnawà:ke and Kanehsatá:ke. This is also in\nconsideration of the oral tradition/history of the island that the\nKanien’kehá:ka Nation has passed from generation to generation. We must\nrecognize the role of the Kanien’kehá:ka in protecting and caring for the lands\nand waters that we share and enjoy today. Their stewardship is a model for how\nwe must collectively respect our natural environment and community as a whole.\n\n3. TIOHTIÀ:KE, COMMONLY KNOWN AS MONTRÉAL, IS HISTORICALLY KNOWN AS A GATHERING\nPLACE FOR MANY FIRST NATIONS.\n\nThe historic and current presence of two Kanien’kehá:ka communities is\nacknowledged by the use of the place name “Tiohtià:ke,” an abbreviation of\n“Teionihtiohtià:kon” which loosely translates as “where the group divided/parted\nways.” It is here “where the group divided/parted ways” that formed a natural\nstopping point for First Nations’ travellers.\n\nThus the region since time immemorial has served as a gathering place which\nmarked the area a key site of diplomacy, as well as for the exchange of culture,\nlanguage, and goods. It is this centrality and importance of the region that\ndrew the first settlers to the island. The importance of Montréal/ Tiohtià:ke\nfor First Nations and Settlers was demonstrated in 1701 when a Great Peace was\nnegotiated and signed thereby ending a series of destructive wars among various\nFirst Nations.\n\n4. TODAY, IT IS HOME TO A DIVERSE POPULATION OF INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLES.\n\nIt is important to include our vibrant urban Indigenous community as well as the\nmany peoples from diverse backgrounds that now reside here.\n\n5. WE RESPECT THE CONTINUED CONNECTIONS WITH THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE IN OUR\nONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLES WITHIN THE MONTRÉAL\nCOMMUNITY.\n\nThis is similar to a gathering of the minds. We are weaving together the past,\npresent, and future of the entire Montréal community that is built on an\nIndigenous foundation. This is a reminder to anyone that is not Indigenous to\nthis place that the history/past enabled us to be here, that Indigenous peoples\nand communities are still present and vital to our prosperity, and that we all\nmust be engaged and invested in our collective future to move forward together.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCONVOCATION (GRADUATION CEREMONIES)\n\nSpring Convocation ceremonies in 2017 included a Territorial Acknowledgement at\nthe start of the proceedings, stated publicly by a lead member of Concordia’s\nadministration. The Indigenous Directions Leadership Group will continue to work\nwith the Convocation planning committees and Concordia’s administration to\nmodify and adapt future convocation ceremonies in a way that includes and\nsupports Indigenous identities, cultures, and languages. Our goal is to develop\nan inclusive and open environment for all Concordia students, staff, faculty,\nand community members. Concordia also supports the choice of any Indigenous\npeoples to wear regalia/cultural dress at Convocation ceremonies in addition to\nor as an alternative to formal academic attire.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen and where to deliver the Territorial Acknowledgement\n\nWHY DOES CONCORDIA HAVE A TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?\n\nConcordia is committed to fostering positive and mutually respectful\nrelationships with local Indigenous peoples and communities, many of whom are\nstudents, staff, and faculty members. A Territorial Acknowledgement is a means\nof recognizing that Indigenous peoples have a long history with the land and\nwaters that we gather upon today and that this is their home and territory. This\ncreates a space for dialogue, community building, and exchange in the true\nspirit of Tiohtià:ke/Montréal by drawing on its deep-rooted history as a place\nof diversity, diplomacy, and economic significance. This is also a way that we\nembrace our role within the territory to ensure the long-term prosperity of our\ndiverse community and the longevity of the lands and waters for future\ngenerations.\n\nWHEN/WHERE CAN THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BE STATED/READ ALOUD?\n\nTypically, the Acknowledgment would be stated at the beginning of any event,\nmeeting or gathering happening at Concordia or sponsored by the university\nwithin the territory. The objective of stating it at the beginning of an event\nis to situate the events and its participants. It also serves as a means of\nreaffirming the type of relationships that we, as an institution, collective, or\nindividual, are establishing with the place and Caretakers of the lands and\nwaters. Therefore, the intention set in the Territorial Acknowledgement should\nbe stated consciously.\n\nIn an effort to foster positive relationships with Indigenous peoples across\nCanada, a similar Territorial Acknowledgement should be stated elsewhere when\nvisiting the territory of another Nation/People. This gesture respects local\nIndigenous peoples and communities outside of Concordia and the Montréal region\nwhen hosting or participating in events within other territories. Simply put, an\nacknowledgement of people, territory or space should not be limited to the\nConcordia campus or Montréal area.\n\nWHEN IS IT APPROPRIATE TO GIVE A TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?\n\nIt is always appropriate to deliver a Territorial Acknowledgement. However,\nthere are times when it is not necessary, for example in regularly scheduled\nteam meetings.\n\nAn Acknowledgement is necessary during special occasions, events, activities and\nmeetings where opening remarks or a speech will be delivered in front of an\naudience. It is also a good practice to deliver an Acknowledgement in high level\nmeetings that only occur a few times per year. \n\nWILL INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AT THE MEETING BE INSULTED IF A TERRITORIAL\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS NOT DELIVERED?\n\nNo. We understand that sometimes people forget or that they are unsure whether\nthey should have. We understand that it’s a learning process and that it will\ntake time before the delivery of a Territorial Acknowledgement becomes second\nnature.\n\nWe are more likely to be frustrated if the Territorial Agreement is delivered\ncarelessly, read word per word and treated as a mandatory and meaningless\nrecitation before the real business starts.\n\nTHE MEETING STARTED AND NO ONE DELIVERED A TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. I FEEL\nIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. CAN I SPONTANEOUSLY GIVE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?\n\nYes. Everyone is at liberty to do so. It is not the sole responsibility of the\nChair to ensure that an Acknowledgement is made. The respectful way to proceed\nin such circumstances is to ask the Chair if you can do so.\n\nIS IT APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO GIVE A BRIEF TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IF SOMEONE\nHAS ALREADY DONE IT OFFICIALLY? THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.\n\nGo for it!\n\nCAN THE TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BE ADDED TO PUBLICATION MATERIALS, WEBSITES\nOR A SYLLABUS?\n\nAbsolutely! The Territorial Acknowledgement is a good starting point for deeper\nconversations about our relationships with the Caretakers of the lands and\nwaters on which we are situated. It is appropriate to open these discussions in\na class, or in any event, as a pedagogical opportunity to learn about history,\nculture, politics, and think critically about our institutional and personal\nrelation with Tiohtià:ke and the diverse peoples who live here today. Please see\nbelow for how to cite the Territorial Acknowledgement.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho to acknowledge\n\nI AM NOT SURE ON WHOSE ANCESTRAL LANDS I AM. HOW DO I FIND OUT?\n\nIf you are close to a college or university, it is useful to consult their\nwebsites to find out and to get a sense of their Territorial Acknowledgments.\nAlternatively, CAUT has published a guide\n[https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory].\nMany larger cities also have adopted Territorial Acknowledgements.  You can\nconsult the website of the city you reside in or that is closest to you.\n\nIf you live close to an Indigenous community or communities, this may also help\nyou determine whose traditional territories you are on. However, it is necessary\nto verify the information since many Indigenous Peoples have been displaced and\nthe territory they find themselves on today may not be their ancestral lands.\nPlus, some territories intersect or were and are still used by a multitude of\nIndigenous Peoples as gathering places.\n\nI AM JOINING A MEETING VIRTUALLY AND I AM NOT ON THE SAME TERRITORY AS\nCONCORDIA, SHOULD I ACKNOWLEDGE THE TERRITORY WHERE I AM PHYSICALLY?\n\nYes. The territory you physically occupy takes precedence.\n\nBUT IT’S A CONCORDIA MEETING, SHOULDN’T I ACKNOWLEDGE THE ANCESTRAL LANDS ON\nWHICH CONCORDIA IS BUILT?\n\nYes. You can acknowledge the territory you find yourself on as well as the\nterritory that Concordia is built on.  An easy way to get around this conundrum\nis to establish in advance who will deliver the Acknowledgement for Concordia.\nAll other participants are then free to acknowledge the other territories they\nare joining from. \n\nIt is important to note that you can deliver your own Territorial\nAcknowledgement even if you find yourself on the same territory as Concordia or\nanother participant at the meeting.\n\n \n\nI CAN’T PRONOUNCE/I AM AFRAID TO MISPRONOUNCE “KANIENKEHÀ:KA” AND “TIOHTIÀ:KE.”\nCAN I JUST USE THE WORD “INDIGENOUS” OR “MOHAWK” INSTEAD?\n\nNo. It is important to mention the specific peoples concerned. All of Canada is\nIndigenous land.  \n\nIt is also important to welcome and adopt the terminology that Indigenous\nPeoples use to designate themselves. Words such as Mohawk and Cree were often\nattributed by other Indigenous nations or by Europeans settlers, often with\nnegative connotations.\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask for help if you do not know how to pronounce Indigenous\nwords.\n\nTo learn the proper pronunciation of Kanienkehà:ka and Tiohtià:ke, listen to the\naudio clips on this page.\n\nWHY CAN’T I USE THE WORD “MOHAWK”? DON’T THE WORDS “MOHAWK” AND “KANIENKEHÀ:KA”\nREFER TO THE SAME PEOPLE?\n\nThe words Mohawk and Kanienkehà:ka do refer to the same people. However, many\nFirst Nations are reclaiming their national and cultural identities by getting\nrid of the colonial terminology used to designate them, terminology that was not\nin use prior to European Contact.\n\nI’M CONFUSED. IN KAHNAWÀ:KE, MANY OF THEIR ORGANIZATIONS STILL USE THE WORD\n“MOHAWK,” LIKE THE MOHAWK COUNCIL OF KAHNAWÀ:KE. WHY CAN’T I USE IT?\n\nThe decolonization of terminology is a lengthy process that often has legal\nimplications. Official band and reserve names are still often imposed by the\nfederal government. It is up to the community to decide which names to use in\nspecific contexts. In the context of the Territorial Acknowledgement, Concordia\nhas chosen to honour the term that the people of Tiohtià:ke use to refer to\nthemselves.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to deliver the Territorial Acknowledgement\n\nWHO CAN STATE/READ ALOUD THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?\n\nA Territorial Acknowledgement can be read aloud/stated by anyone (it does not\nhave to be an Indigenous person). The Acknowledgement is particularly designed\nto assist people that do not identify as Indigenous to situate themselves within\nan Indigenous place/territory. It is also designed to remind people of a deeper\nhistory that is often forgotten or neglected.\n\nTHERE ARE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AT THE MEETING. WOULDN’T IT JUST BE EASIER TO ASK\nONE OF THEM TO DELIVER THE TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT?\n\nIt is disrespectful to ask Indigenous people attending the meeting to deliver a\nTerritorial Acknowledgement, especially if this is their land. The\nAcknowledgement should always be delivered by persons who are guests on the\nland.  \n\nAn Indigenous person who is a guest in Tiohtià:ke can deliver the\nAcknowledgement but it is important not to single out the only Indigenous person\nin the meeting and expect them to deliver the Acknowledgement.\n\nHOW DOES THE INDIGENOUS DIRECTIONS LEADERSHIP COUNCIL DELIVER A TERRITORIAL\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN A MEETING AMONGST THEMSELVES?\n\nA person is usually designated in advance. This person can never be someone who\noriginates from the ancestral lands we are gathering on. All other meeting\nparticipants are free to deliver a short personal Acknowledgement of their own. \n\nI DON’T WANT TO READ THE OFFICIAL TEXT WORD PER WORD. IT’S LONG AND FEELS\nIMPERSONAL. CAN I JUST DELIVER A TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WITHOUT READING\nTHIS TEXT?\n\nThe best way to deliver a Territorial Acknowledgement is to be familiar with the\ntext and give a heartfelt acknowledgement in your own words. \n\nIt is also important to infuse something more personal, for example thanking the\nconcerned Indigenous people for the opportunity to live, work and play on their\nancestral lands or speaking of why it is important to you to acknowledge the\nland you find yourself on.\n\nThe text is an official document, reserved for written communications and formal\naffairs. In other situations, it serves as a guide.\n\nWHY DOES EVERYONE LOOK SO SERIOUS AND SOMBER WHEN THEY DELIVER A TERRITORIAL\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT?\n\nIt is either a personal choice or a desire not to offend. Delivering a\nTerritorial Acknowledgement is serious business but it is not intended to be\ndelivered like a funeral address!\n\nIndigenous cultures are meant to be celebrated. It is perfectly fine to deliver\nan Acknowledgement in a more upbeat manner.\n\nIF I PERSONALLY/MY GROUP, OR DEPARTMENT ALREADY HAS A TERRITORIAL\nACKNOWLEDGMENT, DO I HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH THIS ONE?\n\nOf course not! There are many acceptable ways to acknowledge the territory and\nlocal Indigenous peoples and communities. As our knowledge, experience, and\nrelationships develop and change, so will our ways of acknowledging and\ncollaborating within Tiohtià:ke/Montréal’s Indigenous community. We have also\ndeveloped a few principles to help guide the process of practicing or developing\na Territorial Acknowledgement as a starting point (below).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther questions\n\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AN OPENING OR\nWELCOMING BY AN INDIGENOUS ELDER, KNOWLEDGE KEEPER, OR COMMUNITY MEMBER?\n\nIndigenous peoples and communities have diverse ways of knowing and cultural\nprotocols that guide how they acknowledge each other and recognize the territory\nthey are visiting or residing within. Being Indigenous to a broad area such as\nTurtle Island (North America) is not the same as being part of a specific\ncommunity, Nation, or Territory that has ancestral roots and a relationship to\nparticular place. A welcoming or opening may happen in a variety of ways, here\nare some examples:\n\na) Indigenous visitors: When visiting the traditional territory of another\nIndigenous community, Nation or People — an Indigenous person may draw on their\nown cultural knowledge and protocols to acknowledge the local Indigenous\ncommunity to the best of their ability. They may refer to the relationship or\nhistory between the two communities, or their personal experiences.\n\nb) By making an offering/gift of: tobacco, medicines, food, seeds, personal\nbelongings, words, and/or songs.\n\nc) Opening: Ohèn:ton Karihwatéhkwen “Matters/Issues that come before (all\nelse)”. This is sometimes referred to as a “Thanksgiving address” or “gathering\nof the minds.” It is the formal way that Kanien’kehá:ka (People of the Flint,\nMohawk) open and begin all types of gatherings. The words and the length of the\naddress vary according to the speaker. It is typically done in Kanien’kéha\n(Mohawk language) and may or may not include a tobacco burning.\n\nWHAT IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A GATHERING AT CONCORDIA, AN OPENING OR TERRITORIAL\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT? CAN WE DO BOTH?\n\nYes, you can do both. However, the preference of an Elder/community member that\nhas agreed to open an event takes precedence. Ask them how they prefer to be\nintroduced and if they are comfortable with a Territorial Acknowledgement being\npart of their introduction or the opening. If the event includes Indigenous\npeoples from many territories, the representative from the local Indigenous\nterritory takes precedence. Respect how they wish to proceed. If at any point\nyou feel you must choose between an opening or a Territorial Acknowledgement, go\nwith an opening as it has more significance to the territory and to the\ncommunity. We have developed comprehensive guidelines\n[/indigenous/resources/elder.html] explaining the appropriate protocols to\nfollow when working with Indigenous Elders, Knowledge Keepers and community\nmembers.\n\nHOW DO I CITE THIS TERRITORIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT?\n\nIn recognition of the work that was done by members of the Indigenous Directions\nLeadership Group in creating this Territorial Acknowledgement, it is recommended\nto cite it as follows:\n\n“This Territorial Acknowledgement and resources were created by Concordia\nUniversity’s Indigenous Directions Leadership Group (2017).
